In the  Login Settings section, you can create, edit, and delete login warnings, and configure user agreements.
For more information, see Configuring Login Settings.

Creating, Editing, and Deleting Users
A user is assigned to every person using VideoManager. Different users have varying levels of control over the system, depending on how they have been configured.

As well as creating users manually, it is also possible to configure VideoManager so that workers can create their own users. For more information, see Configuring User Self Service.

Creating Users
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Users pane.
Click the  Users section.
In the top right-hand corner, click  Create user.
In the User name field, enter a name for the user.
Note:
Each user must have a unique username. The username can be changed later but it cannot be changed to another user's username.

If the user is assigned to a device that is still in the field, the device becomes associated with the "deleted" user, which is the old username, as well as any media that is still on the device.

In the Password field, enter a password for the user.
Note: After you enter the password, the User must change password toggle is automatically set to On and the user is prompted to set their own password the first time they log on.
You should configure when the password should expire from the Password Complexity section. For more information, see Configuring Password Complexity.

To confirm the password, in the Confirm password field, enter the same password.
In the Display name field, enter a display name for the user.
The display name can be changed later.
Optional: In the Email notifications field, enter an email address for the user.
Users can receive notifications via email when specific actions are performed on VideoManager. The exact actions that prompt a notification are determined by the user's roles.

Users can reset their own password, if the feature has been configured from the User Self Service section.

Users may need to click a link sent to their email before they can log on to VideoManager, if the feature has been configured from the Two Factor Authentication section. Users without email addresses in this field will not be able to log on.

In the Touch assign ID field, enter the touch assign ID to identify a user's RFID card with a device.
This field is only relevant if the user is assigned a device with RFID. For more information, see Devices Assignment and Media Recording.
If you want to find the RFID value of a card, you must touch the relevant card to the RFID reader and click  in the Touch assign ID field. This action shows a list of failed touch assign scans. The most recent entry is for that failed scan, which you can copy and paste into the Touch assign ID field.

Note: If a user should be associated with multiple RFID cards (for example, if they have a door card and a warrant card), you can repeat the procedure for as many cards as necessary, but you must separate the touch assign IDs with a comma in the Touch assign ID field (for example, <543642,873924>).
If you want to enable the user to log on to VideoManager, set Enabled to On. Otherwise, set the toggle to Off.
In the  Roles pane, select the roles that the user should inhabit.
This action determines which aspects of VideoManager the user can see and interact with.
The user's roles can be changed later. For more information, see Performing Roles Actions.

In the  Group memberships pane, select the groups to which the user should belong, enter the name of a previously created group, and click .
The groups can be changed later. For more information, see Creating, Editing, and Deleting Groups.
In the  Sharing pane, select the sharing options required for the user.
The options are as follows:
Auto share with – Any users or groups entered here have access to all media files, incidents, and exports created by the new user.
Note: Users cannot see who their media files are auto-shared with, or if they are auto-shared at all.
For new media, create shares for – Any users or groups entered here are automatically entered into the Shared: field of new media files recorded by the new user.
This option is useful if certain users or groups should have access to media files recorded by the new user, but should not have access to all of their exports or incidents, which Auto share with would grant.

For new incidents, create shares for – Any users or groups entered here are automatically entered into the Shared: field of new incidents created by the new user.
This option is useful if certain users or groups should have access to incidents created by the new user, but should not have access to all of their exports or media files, which Auto share with would grant.

Supervisor of – Any users or groups entered here are supervised by the new user, which means that the user can view their media files, incidents, and exports from the Supervised Media, Supervised Incidents, and Supervised Exports panes.
To add the user or group, click .
If required, from the  WiFi networks pane, add user-specific WiFi networks by clicking  Add network.
These networks only appear on the user's account, and are not viewable by other users on the system. For more information, see Creating User-Specific WiFi Networks.
Click Create user.
Editing Users
It can be necessary to edit a user if their password should be changed, or if they should be assigned to different roles.
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Users pane.
Click the  Users section.
Locate the user to be edited by filtering users in one of the following ways:
In the Name field, enter the user's username or display name.
In the Authentication ID field, enter the user's authentication ID.
In the In group field, enter the group name of the user's group.
If you enter a group name in the In group field, you have the option to change if Only immediate members is set to On or not. If set to On, only users that are assigned directly to the specified group are returned, as opposed to if user A is assigned indirectly to group B because A belongs to group C, which is assigned to group B.

In the Email field, enter the user's email.
In the User UUID field, enter the user's UUID which is a unique, non-sequential ID for a user.
Note: You need correct permissions to either view or search by this field. For more information, see User Permissions.
From the Role drop-down list, select the user's relevant role.
You can click  to reset the filter.

Click Find.
Next to the user to be edited, click  Go to user.
Make the necessary changes and click Save user.
Deleting Users
If a worker leaves an organisation, it can be necessary to delete their user from VideoManager. Deleting a user does not delete any of their media files or incidents.
Optionally, you can reassign the relevant user to another user on VideoManager. This action transfers all of their incidents, exports, and media files to the other user. For more information, see Reassigning Users. If the user is not reassigned, the Operator field for their media files reads as <deleted user's name> (DELETED). If a user is later recreated with the same username, all of the media files, exports, and incidents associated with that username are automatically associated with that user.

Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Users pane.
Click the  Users section.
Locate the user to be deleted by filtering users in one of the following ways:
In the Name field, enter the user's username or display name.
In the Authentication ID field, enter the user's authentication ID.
In the In group field, enter the group name of the user's group.
If you enter a group name in the In group field, you have the option to change if Only immediate members is set to On or not. If set to On, only users that are assigned directly to the specified group are returned, as opposed to if user A is assigned indirectly to group B because A belongs to group C, which is assigned to group B.

In the Email field, enter the user's email.
In the User UUID field, enter the user's UUID which is a unique, non-sequential ID for a user.
Note: You need correct permissions to either view or search by this field. For more information, see User Permissions.
From the Role drop-down list, select the user's relevant role.
You can click  to reset the filter.
Click Find.
Next to the user to be deleted, click  Go to user.
Click  Delete user.
In the confirmation window, click Yes.
Reassigning Users
Reassigning a user transfers all of their media files and incidents to another user. This action is advised if a user has left an organisation and they should no longer have access to VideoManager, or if an organisation plans to reuse usernames on VideoManager. After a user is recreated with the same username as a previously deleted user, all media files and incidents associated with that username are reassigned to the user, even if it is not the same worker.

Reassignment can be done before or after a user has been deleted from the system.

Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Users pane.
Click the  Users section.
In the top right-hand corner, click  Reassign user.
In the Current owner field, enter the name of the user whose media files and incidents will be transferred.
If the user still exists on VideoManager, their name pops up when typed in. If the user has been deleted, their name does not pop up when typed in, but is available for reassignment.
In the New owner field, enter the name of the user who should receive the media files and incidents.
Click Reassign.
Unlocking Users
You can configure how many login attempts a user can make before their account is locked, and for how long their account is subsequently locked, from the  Password Complexity section of the  Users pane in the Admin tab. If a user's account is locked, they cannot log on to VideoManager until their account is either unlocked by VideoManager automatically, or by an administrator manually.
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Users pane.
Click the  Users section.
Next to the user to be unlocked, click  Go to user.
The Status of a locked user reads as Locked and it has an  icon next to its username.
Set Unlock now to Yes.
Tip: If the user made too many incorrect login attempts because they forgot their password, you can also reset their password from this pane by entering the new password in the Password and Confirm password fields.
Click Save user.
Exporting and Importing Users and Groups
You can download the database of users and groups to a CSV file, which enables you to edit the database in Excel, then reupload the same CSV file to VideoManager.

Exporting the Database from VideoManager
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Users pane.
Click the  Users section.
Click  Export users and groups.
The CSV file is downloaded to your PC containing information about the users and groups. The file includes the users' roles and relationships, such as which users belong to which groups. You can edit the file in Excel.
Importing the Database into VideoManager
After editing the file, you can import the database back into VideoManager.
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Users pane.
Click the  Users section.
Click  Import users and groups.
Click Choose file and select the previously exported CSV file.
VideoManager automatically performs a "dry run", allowing you to preview the changes before they come into effect. The following fields display:
Users and groups added: lists the number of users and groups which are in the CSV file but not on VideoManager.
Users and groups updated: lists the number of users and groups whose data in the CSV file does not match the data on VideoManager.
Users and groups removed: lists the number of users and groups which are on VideoManager but not in the CSV file.
Click Import.
The following changes take place:
All users and groups which are in the CSV file but not on VideoManager are added.
All users and groups whose data in the CSV file does not match the data on VideoManager are updated.
All users and groups which are on VideoManager but not in the CSV file are deleted.
Postrequisites:
You can import the CSV file into a new instance of VideoManager. This action copies the database at the time of export, and may be useful if you do not want to configure the built-in user import tool. To do so, follow the same procedure for importing users and groups but ensure that the roles on the new instance of VideoManager match the roles in the CSV file. If the roles in the CSV file do not match the role names on the new instance of VideoManager, the import job fails.

To import a role:

Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Users pane.
Click the  Roles section.
Click  Export role.
On the new instance of VideoManager, navigate to the same place, and click  Import role.
Viewing and Clearing Device Affinities for Users
If Enable shift-long field trips has been set to On from the Devices section, all users who have been assigned a device with single issue (either with RFID or through VideoManager) have an affinity with their device. This means that if they dock their device in the middle of their shift, VideoManager makes a note of the connection and allows them to undock the same device later in the shift. You can view these affinities from the Edit user pane.
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Users pane.
Click the  Users section.
Next to the relevant user, click  Go to user.
Click  View device affinity.
The Device Affinity window opens.
The window shows all devices that have been associated with the user via single issue (either with RFID or through VideoManager), undocked, and then redocked again.

The window can be empty for one of the following reasons:

The device has not been docked yet.
The affinity is not created until the device is docked within the user's shift for the first time

The device was assigned to the user with permanent issue which does not create an affinity between the user and the device, because the same device is always associated with the user.
When the device was redocked, it charged fully.
When the device was redocked, it was manually unassigned by an administrator.
The shift has elapsed as determined from the Devices section of the Devices pane, in the Admin tab.
To clear the affinity, click  Clear.
If the user docks the device during their shift, the device returns to the pool and must obey the configured battery requirements before it can be used. The user must either swipe their RFID card again, or have another device assigned to them on VideoManager, before they can record more media during their shift.
For more information, see Configuring Device Settings.

To return to the Edit user pane, click Close.
Creating, Editing, and Deleting Groups
You can create groups to associate certain users with each other. This action can be necessary if an organisation wants to share certain media files or incidents with lots of users at once, or if certain users should supervise other users. Groups can be members of groups themselves.
Creating Groups
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Users pane.
Click the  Groups section.
Click  Create group.
In the Group name field, enter a name for the group.
This field cannot be edited later.
In the Display name field, enter a display name for the group.
Note: A group cannot have the same name as an existing user or group on the system. However, a group and user can have the same display name.
In the  Roles pane, enable the pre-existing roles that should apply to all users in this group.
This action does not add all users that inhabit the role to the group.
In the  Group memberships pane, enter the names of the groups to which this group should belong, and to add the user or group, click .
You can also add individual users to groups from the user's page. For more information, see Creating, Editing, and Deleting Users.
In the  Sharing pane, configure any of the following fields.
The options are as follows:
Option	Description
Auto share with	Any users or groups entered here have access to all media files, incidents, and exports created by the group.
Note: Users in a group cannot see who their media files are auto-shared with, or if they are auto-shared at all.
If group A auto shares with a user, then every user in group A shares their incidents with that user.

If group A auto shares with group B, then every user in group A auto shares their incidents with every user in group B.

For new media, create shares for	Any users or groups entered here are automatically entered into the Shared: field of new media files recorded or imported by the users within this group.
This option is useful if certain users or groups should have access to media files recorded or imported by the users in this group, but should not have access to all of their exports or incidents, which Auto share with would grant.

For new incidents, create shares for	Any users or groups entered here are automatically entered into the Shared: field of new incidents created by the users in this group.
This option is useful if certain users or groups should have access to incidents created by the users in this group, but should not have access to all of their exports or media files, which Auto share with would grant.

Supervisor of	This option determines which users and groups are supervised by this group.
If group A supervises a user, then every user in group A supervises that user.

If group A supervises group B, then every user in group A supervises every user in group B.

Note: The supervision applies to incidents, exports, and devices.
To add the group, click .
Optional: In the  WiFi networks pane, create user-specific WiFi networks that should only be available to all users in the group.
This action can be necessary if all users in a group will be live streaming media with their devices, over a specific hotspot.
Click Create group.
After a group has been created, other users and groups can be added to it. For more information, see Creating, Editing, and Deleting Users.
Editing Groups
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Users pane.
Click the  Groups section.
Locate the group to be edited by filtering groups in one of the following ways:
In the Name field, enter the group's username or display name.
In the In group field, enter the group name.
If you enter a group name in the In group field, you have the option to change if Only immediate members is set to On or not. If set to On, only groups that are assigned directly to the specified group are returned, as opposed to if group A is assigned indirectly to group B because A belongs to group C, which is assigned to group B.

From the Role drop-down list, select the group's relevant role.
You can click  to reset the filter.
Click Find.
Next to the group to be edited, click  Go to group.
Make the necessary changes and click Save group.
Deleting Groups
If a group becomes redundant, it can be deleted. Deleting a group does not delete any of the users within it. Instead, it immediately affects what those users can see on VideoManager, and to which media files/exports/incidents they have access.
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Users pane.
Click the  Groups section.
Locate the group to be edited by filtering groups in one of the following ways:
In the Name field, enter the group's username or display name.
In the In group field, enter the group name.
If you enter a group name in the In group field, you have the option to change if Only immediate members is set to On or not. If set to On, only groups that are assigned directly to the specified group are returned, as opposed to if group A is assigned indirectly to group B because A belongs to group C, which is assigned to group B.

From the Role drop-down list, select the group's relevant role.
You can click  to reset the filter.
Click Find.
Next to the group to be deleted, click  Go to group.
Click  Delete group.
In the confirmation window, click Yes.
If users belong to the deleted group, their permissions and abilities are altered immediately, depending on how the group was configured. This could mean that the users no longer inhabit certain roles, or no longer have access to other users' media files/exports/incidents.
Creating a Group for Use with the M500/M500E
Unlike body worn devices, where one user is assigned to one device, the M500/M500E should be assigned to a group of users. All users within this group will be then able to log on to using the control panel, and operate the M500/M500E in the ﬁeld. You must manually create this group on VideoManager.
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Users pane.
Click the  Groups section.
In the top right-hand corner, click  Create group.
Enter a name for the group.
For example, M500 Users
Optional: In the Display name field, enter a display name for the group.
The display name can be changed later.
In the right-hand  Roles pane, ensure that Vehicle Operator is set to On for the group.
Click Create group.
Add all of the users to be operating M500/M500Es to this group by performing the following actions:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Users pane.
Click the  Users section.
Next to the relevant user, click  Go to user.
In the  Group memberships section, enter the previously created group name and click .
Click Save user.
Viewing Effective Permissions for Users or Groups
After a user or group has been created, their effective permissions can be viewed, which gives administrators insight into how the user or group's permissions and roles interact with each other.
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Users pane.
Click either the  Users or  Groups section.
Next to the relevant user or group, click  Go to user or  Go to group.
Click  View effective permissions.
The following information is viewable:
Name	Description
 Assigned roles	
For a user, this pane shows the roles they inhabit, and how they got those roles, that is whether the user itself has the role, or whether it belongs to a group that has the role.
For a group, this pane shows the roles every user in the group inhabit, and how they got those roles, that is whether the group itself has the role, or whether it belongs to another group that has the role.
 Assigned groups	For a user/group, this pane shows the groups they belong to, if any.
 Assigned WiFi networks	For a user/group, this pane shows which user-specific WiFi networks they have been assigned, if any.
If the user-specific WiFi networks are not included in the default network profile on VideoManager (because User-specific networks has been set to Off), a warning appears alerting the administrator to this fact.

This is relevant because devices assigned via single issue (with RFID) and permanent allocation automatically use the default network profile. If user-specific WiFi networks are not enabled for the default network profile, these devices cannot use them to live stream media.

 Device profiles	This pane shows the user/group's device profiles.
The user/group could have these device profiles because:

The user/group has a role with which the device profiles are associated.
The user/group is assigned to a group that has the role with which the device profiles are associated.
Note: Default device profiles are marked with . The default device profiles are automatically presented when the user is assigning a device.
Permissions	For a user/group, this pane on the right-hand side shows their sum total of permissions.
The user/group could have these permissions because:

The user/group has a role, which contains the permissions.
The user/group is assigned to a group that has the role, which contains the permissions.
Users within this group have these permissions in addition to the permissions they would have from the roles they inhabit.

To return to the  Users or  Groups section, click  Back.
Performing Roles Actions
A role is a collection of permissions within VideoManager, which can then be assigned to users. Roles determine what actions users can take on VideoManager, and what aspects of the UI they can see. Each user can have several roles assigned to them.

VideoManager provides the following default roles:

 System Administrator – Users assigned to this role can access all aspects of the VideoManager UI, such as deleting incidents, creating other users, and more.
Device Operator – Users assigned to this role can record media files. They cannot perform any other actions on VideoManager, and cannot log on.
System User – Users assigned to this role can view their own media files, and media files shared with them. They cannot operate devices, or access the Admin tab.
System Supervisor – Users assigned to this role can view their own media files and those recorded by users they are supervising. They cannot operate devices, or access the Admin tab.
System Manager – Users assigned to this role can view all media files on VideoManager, assign devices, and perform actions on incidents.
Users may find it necessary to create their own roles, tailored to their workflow. Every default role except System Administrator can be edited manually.

Creating Roles
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Users pane.
Click the  Roles section.
Click  Create role.
In the Name field, enter a name for the role.
In the Description field, enter a description for the role.
Optional: From the  Default device profiles drop-down list, select which previously created device profiles should apply to devices that have been assigned to users in this role.
Devices assigned with RFID use this device profile automatically. If devices are assigned manually, users can override this device profile if they have the correct permissions.

The administrator should choose a device profile for each device family. If they do not do so, the default device profile is used.

If a user belongs to multiple roles, but all of the device profiles for roles are set to the system default except one, the one that is not the system default is used.

If a user belongs to multiple roles, but some of the device profiles for roles are not set to the system default, the device profile that is highest in the device profile list, apart from the default profile, is used.

Note: This list can be reordered from the Device Settings section of the Devices pane, in the Admin tab. From here, you can also change the system default device profile.
Set additional options for the new role using any of the following toggles.
If Add new users to this role? is set to On, any new users created on VideoManager from now on automatically inhabit this role.
If Use alternate password complexity? is set to Yes, the users in this role must set a password which conforms to the alternate password rules, instead of the normal password rules.
For more information, see Configuring Password Complexity.

From the Role assignment tier drop-down list, select which tier this role should belong to.
By default, roles belong to tier 1. Users can only add other users to roles that are in the same tier or lower as their own roles.

For example, if user A's role is in tier 2, they can only add other users to roles which are also in tier 2, or lower. This means they cannot add other users, or themselves, to roles which are in tier 1.

Note: Even users with the Assign higher privileges permission are not able to add other users to roles that are in a higher tier than their own role.
Two factor authentication – If two factor authentication has already been configured, administrators can configure whether users in this role must scan a QR code with their phone before they can log on to VideoManager.
For more information, see Enabling Two Factor Authentication.

Requires privilege elevation? – Although some aspects of role elevation can be configured from this pane, it is a multi-step process.
For more information, see Configuring Privilege Escalation.

Configure permissions for the role.
This action determines what actions users in this role can perform. For more information, see Enable and Disable Permissions.
To save the role, click Create role.
Copying Roles
Copying a role duplicates the entire role except its name and is useful if you want to create many similar roles on your instance of VideoManager.
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Users pane.
Click the  Roles section.
Next to the role to be copied, click  Copy role.
The role is copied and opened for editing, with the Name field left blank.
Note: It is not possible to create two roles with the same name.
To save the changes, click Create role.
Editing Roles
It can be necessary to edit a role if the responsibilities of a user have changed.
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Users pane.
Click the  Roles section.
Next to the role to be edited, click  Go to role.
You can edit the properties, such as Name, Description, and Default device profiles, and permissions of a role.
Click Save role.
Deleting Roles
It can be necessary to delete a role if it has become obsolete.
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Users pane.
Click the  Roles section.
Next to the role to be deleted, click  Delete role.
A confirmation window opens to alert if there are users associated with the role.
Click Yes.
Note: If users are associated with the role you want to delete, their ability to use VideoManager may be compromised once the role has been deleted. If the deleted role was the user's only role, they are unable to access VideoManager until they have been assigned a new role.
Enable and Disable Permissions
A permission is an individual rule, which determines the actions users can perform on VideoManager.

For a comprehensive list of all permissions, see Permissions.

A user's permissions are the union of their roles. This means that if a user belongs to two roles, one of which has the permission Log in to VideoManager application set to On and one that has it set to Off, that user will still be able to log on. There are no permissions that deny an action. Only the absence of permissions denies actions.

The groups of permissions are as follows:

System permissions control users' abilities to log on to VideoManager, as well as their audit and export abilities.

Authentication Realms Configuration
By default, users log on to VideoManager with a username and password. However, administrators can also configure the system so that users can log on with their Windows credentials, other single sign-on credentials, or a certificate.
Creating Windows Authentication Realm
The following procedure describes how to configure Windows Authentication for an on-premises instance of VideoManager. If you want to conﬁgure Windows Authentication for a cloud instance of VideoManager, see VideoManager (Cloud) and Windows Active Directory Explained.
If you are using an on-premises instance of VideoManager which has been installed within your domain, you can use local authentication, which means that any users within the domain can log on to VideoManager, regardless of the speciﬁc PC.

Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Users pane.
Click the  Authentication Methods section.
Click  New realm.
From the Authentication type drop-down list, select Windows Authentication.
From the Visibility type drop-down list, configure how users will access the login button for the realm:
If you want the login realm to be displayed as a button on the login page, select Standard.
If you want the button of the login realm to be visible on the login page only if the user clicks Show advanced login methods, select Advanced.
If you want only users who have access to the realm’s unique URL to be able to log on with it, select Hidden.
You can copy this URL once the realm has been created.

In the Identifier field, enter a unique name for this realm.
In the Label field, enter the text to be displayed on the button for this realm.
For example, Click here.
Ensure that Enabled is set to Yes.
If set to No, users will not be able to log on with this realm.
Set Use passthrough login matcher to Yes and fill in the required fields.
The default value in the Passthrough login matcher ﬁeld prompts VideoManager to ignore the [domain]\ portion of Windows usernames and recognize only the user’s actual username.
Users can only use their Windows credentials to log on to VideoManager if their usernames match across both systems. Enabling this setting means that you do not have to create users on VideoManager whose usernames all include [domain]\.

If you want users to be automatically assigned to a group, set Auto set group membership to Yes.
From the Authentication type drop-down list, select Windows Auth via local.
Click Save.
The server restarts.
Creating Single Sign-On Authentication Realm
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Users pane.
Click the  Authentication Methods section.
Click  New realm.
From the Authentication type drop-down list, select Single Sign-On (OAuth2).
From the Visibility type drop-down list, configure how users will access the login button for the realm:
If you want the login realm to be displayed as a button on the login page, select Standard.
If you want the button of the login realm to be visible on the login page only if the user clicks Show advanced login methods, select Advanced.
If you want only users who have access to the realm’s unique URL to be able to log on with it, select Hidden.
You can copy this URL once the realm has been created.

In the Identifier field, enter a unique name for this realm.
In the Label field, enter the text to be displayed on the button for this realm.
For example, Click here or Log in with Okta.
Ensure that Enabled is set to Yes.
If set to No, users will not be able to log on with this realm.
Optional: To map the ID in the client certificate to the VideoManager username, set Use passthrough login matcher to Yes and fill in the required fields.
If set to No, VideoManager assumes that the full ID in the client certificate maps on to a username.
In the Issuer URL, Client ID, and Client secret fields, enter the corresponding information for the realm.
From the Response type drop-down list, select how the realm will authenticate against the OpenID provider.
If you are unsure, select code.
In the Login prompt field, determine how the OAuth2 provider will prompt users for authentication.
This is determined on a per-provider basis. Common values include:
Blank – The user will be prompted to authenticate, unless they are already logged on to the OAuth2 session.
login – The user will always be prompted to authenticate, even if they are already logged on to the OAuth2 session.
select_account – The authorization server will promt the user to select a user account. This allows a user who has multiple accounts on the authorization server to select one of the accounts that they may have current sessions for.
none – The user will never be prompted to authenticate, even if they are not already logged on.
If you want a user to be logged out of their OAuth2 session once they log out of VideoManager, set OAuth2 logout enabled to Yes.
This applies if the user manually logs out of VideoManager, or if they are automatically logged out after a period of inactivity.
Optional: To verify that URLs are working and the service is available, next to the Text configuration field, click Test
The test cannot validate client credentials or claims.
In the User Claim field, enter the claim which will map users from your OpenID database to the VideoManager user database.
From the User claim mapping drop-down list, select which claim will map users from your VideoManageruser database to your external user database.
The options are as follows:
Username – Your VideoManager users will be mapped to your OpenID database via their usernames.
Authentication ID – Your VideoManager users will be mapped to your OpenID database via their unique authentication ID.
Selecting Authentication ID is convenient if you are migrating from one login system to another, for example from VideoManager usernames to OAuth2. This action ensures that you do not have to change the usernames, or create new users and migrate media. It also allows “dual running” for some period of time without disruption.

If Auto Provisioning on Login is set to On, any correctly authenticated OAUTH2 user is automatically provisioned with a specified group along with those group permissions, even if they do not have an account in VideoManager. In order to use this feature, the response type needs to be set to code and the authentication provider needs to return the user's group claims as a list in the authentication token.
The following options appear:
In the Group claim field, enter the claim that will map groups from your OpenID database to the VideoManager group database.
In the Groups field, enter the name of an existing group that the user will be automatically added to and click .
If Legacy provisioning mode is set to On, the user is created automatically if they are an OAuth2 provider.
Note: Do not enable this mode unless advised by the technical support.
More options appear such as:
Name claim field;
 to add default roles;
Group Mappings section that allows for creating group mappings.
Click Save.
The server restarts.
Creating Client Certificate Authentication Realm
Prerequisites:

Create a user. For more information, see Creating, Editing, and Deleting Users.
Configure VideoManager listen addresses. For more information, see Configuring Listen and Public Addresses of VideoManager.
Note: The address that users use to access the login page must have the same hostname as the server address and must include https. You must ensure that the browser accepts the certificate and does not show any warnings.
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Users pane.
Click the  Authentication Methods section.
Click  New realm.
From the Authentication type drop-down list, select Client Certificate Authentication.
From the Visibility type drop-down list, configure how users will access the login button for the realm:
If you want the login realm to be displayed as a button on the login page, select Standard.
If you want the button of the login realm to be visible on the login page only if the user clicks Show advanced login methods, select Advanced.
If you do not want the login realm to be visible on the login page, select Hidden.
In the Identifier field, enter a unique name for this realm.
For example, cert-auth
In the Label field, enter the text to be displayed on the button for this realm.
For example, Click here.
Ensure that Enabled is set to Yes.
If set to No, users will not be able to log on with this realm.
Optional: To map the ID in the client certificate to the VideoManager username, set Use passthrough login matcher to Yes and fill in the required fields.
If set to No, VideoManager assumes that the full ID in the client certificate maps on to a username.
To upload new certificate, in the Client Certificate Authentication section, click .
Click Choose file.
It is usually a .crt or .pem file.
Select the certificate and click Open.
Enter the password.
Click OK.
Optional: In the Error Message field, enter an error message to be displayed on the login screen when login is denied.
For example, A login error occurred. If the problem persists, close the window and open it again.
Click Save.
The server restarts.
Configuring Password Complexity
You can customise the VideoManager password settings to meet existing security regulations, and make VideoManager more secure.

The  Password Complexity section is divided into Primary and Alternate requirements. By default, all passwords must meet the primary requirements. However, if there is a need for administrative passwords to be more secure than user passwords, the alternate requirements can be set more stringently and any role can be set to require passwords to meet them instead.

Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Users pane.
Click the  Password Complexity section.
In the Minimum password length field, enter the minimum number of characters which users must meet.
In the Minimum hours between password changes field, enter the minimum number of hours for which a user's password must exist, after which it can be changed by them.
This action only affects a user's ability to change their own password from the Update password pane of their Account Profile tab. You can still update passwords from the  Users section, even if doing so violates the rule configured here.
For more information, see Creating, Editing, and Deleting Users.

Configure the password complexity by any of the following criteria:
If Must contain lowercase is set to On, a password must have at least one lowercase letter.
If Must contain uppercase is set to On, a password must have at least one uppercase letter.
If Must contain number is set to On, a password must have at least one number.
If Must contain symbol is set to On, a password must have at least one symbol.
If Disallow username in password is set to On, a user cannot include their username in their password.
If Disallow repeated characters is set to On, a password cannot have the same character multiple times in a row.
You must set the maximum number of repeated characters allowed by VideoManager. For example, if the number is set to 1, then the password Bubble would be deemed inadmissible because it has two bs in a row.

If Disallow password reuse is set to On, a password cannot match the user's previous passwords.
You must enter the number of previous passwords, which the new password cannot match.

If Require periodic password changes is set to On, you must enter the number of days after which passwords on VideoManager must be reset.
If Prevent repeated login attempts is set to On, you must enter the number of times someone can try to log on to VideoManager unsuccessfully, after which their account will be locked. You must also enter the number of minutes for which the profile will be locked, before users can try to log on again.
Suitably privileged users can unlock other users from the  Users section of the  Users pane, in the Admin tab. For more information, see Unlocking Users.

If Temporary password expire is set to On, a temporary password given to a user if, for example, they forget their password, expires after a set number of hours. You must enter the number of hours for which the password is valid.
If Alternate is set to On, the same password restrictions must be configured.
Any roles that utilise the alternate password complexity must have Alternate set to Yes. For more information, see Performing Roles Actions.

Click Save settings.
If the password requirements for a role change, users must change their password upon next login so it meets the new requirements.
Enabling Two Factor Authentication
By default, users log on to VideoManager with their username and unique password. If an organisation needs an extra layer of security, two factor authentication can be enabled and configured, which prompts users to scan a QR code with their phones, and enter the corresponding code into VideoManager.

Two factor authentication must be enabled on VideoManager before individual users can utilise it.

Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Users pane.
Click the  Two Factor Authentication section.
From the Authentication settings drop-down list, select how two factor authentication should behave on VideoManager.
The options are as follows:
Mandatory – Two factor authentication is mandatory for every user on this instance of VideoManager, regardless of whether it is disabled for individual roles or not.
Per role – Two factor authentication is determined on a role-by-role basis.
For more information, see Configuring Two Factor Authentication for Roles.

Disabled – Two factor authentication is disabled for this entire instance of VideoManager.
Click Save settings.
Every user that is affected by the two factor authentication settings is prompted to associate their phone with VideoManager the next time they log on. For more information, see Setting Up Two Factor Authentication.
Configuring Two Factor Authentication for Roles
If two factor authentication has been set to Per role from the  Login Settings section, you must now manually enable two factor authentication for individual roles.

Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Users pane.
Click the  Roles section.
Next to the role to be edited, click  Go to role.
From the TOTP two-factor authentication drop-down list, configure the two factor authentication settings that should affect all users in this role.
The options are as follows:
Mandatory – Two factor authentication is the only function that a user in this role can perform when they first log on, and every login after that requires a 6-digit code to be entered as provided to the user via an app.
Optional – The user is not required to go through two factor authentication when initially logging on. However, they can enable it from their Account profile page once they are logged on to VideoManager.
Disabled – Two factor authentication is not requested upon first login, and users cannot enable it from their Account profile page.
Note: If a user inhabits two roles with contrasting two factor authentication rules, for example, one is set to Disabled and one is set to Mandatory, the user needs to utilise two factor authentication.
Click Save role.
Setting Up Two Factor Authentication
After two factor authentication has been configured, all users affected by it must configure their phones so they work with VideoManager. Users must configure their phones if they belong to a role that has had TOTP two-factor authentication set to Mandatory, or if Authentication settings have been set to Mandatory for the entirety of VideoManager.
Procedure:
Download an authenticator app onto a phone.
Motorola Solutions recommends Google Authenticator.
Log on to VideoManager as normal.
You are asked to set up two factor authentication.
Click Set up.

Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Devices pane.
Click the  Device Settings section.
Optional: In the Touch assign section, perform one of the following actions:
If only devices with a full battery should be eligible for touch assign, set Full battery required to On.
If you set Full battery required to Off, enter a minimum charge time, before which the device cannot be assigned by RFID.
Devices that have been permanently allocated to a user are the exception. In this case, the devices can be tapped out by an RFID card even when they have not met the minimum charge time.

Optional: In the Device discovery section, perform one of the following actions:
If VideoManager should discover all devices that are connected via USB, configured docks, or unconfigured docks, set Enable device discovery to On.
If VideoManager should only discover devices that are connected to docks, set Enable device discovery to Off.
Any devices connected by USB do not appear on the Devices tab.

Optional: In the Device setup section, perform any of the following actions:
From the Default device assignment mode drop-down list, select which device assignment mode should be the default.
This action saves time when devices are being assigned and one assignment mode is used consistently in an organisation. The options are as follows:

Single issue – The device is assigned to a user and when it is redocked, it becomes unassigned and must be reassigned manually.
Permanent issue – The device is assigned to the user and when it is redocked, it stays assigned to the same user.
Permanent allocation – The device is allocated to a user, who must tap an RFID card before they can use it in the field. When the device is redocked, it stays allocated to the same user.
Note: In the Device Field Trip, Operator Recorder Summary, and User Summary reports, devices in this mode are marked as Unassigned if they have been allocated but not tapped out with an RFID card.
Set Show public QR code bootstrap screen to either On or Off.
If set to On, users have the option to launch a public version of the QR config page when configuring a VT-series device, which is useful if remote workers do not have access to VideoManager, but still need to assign their devices. An administrator can send them the link to the public page, and the remote worker can use it to assign their devices from their own office or home.

If set to Off, only users with direct access to VideoManager can assign VT-series devices via QR code. For more information, see Connecting VT-Series Cameras to VideoManager Remotely.

Set Configure External Application account credentials to On.
Note: Configure External Application account credentials should only be set to On if directed to do so by Motorola Solutions support.
In the Bluetooth address prefix field, set the range of MAC addresses with which devices can pair.
For more information about setting up radio integration with VB400s, see VideoManager and Tetra Radio Integration Explained or VB400 and MOTOTRBO Radio Integration Explained.

Optional: In the Device offloads section, perform any of the following actions:
To set the limit for the offload speed of simultaneous offloads performed by devices, in the Limit simultaneous offloads to field, enter the desired number of megabits per second.
This value is an approximation used to limit the number of offloads performed at once, and does not do any rate limiting.

Increasing this value beyond the total available bandwidth of connected docks does not increase the offload throughput.

When a media download is interrupted and connection is then re-established, to resume downloading from the same point before connection was broken, set Fast download recovery to On.
If set to Off, when a media download is interrupted and connection is then re-established, the download starts from the beginning.

If you want devices to offload their oldest media to VideoManager first, set Offload oldest media file first to On.
Note: The system default offloads most recent media first. This action is necessary if media are to be transferred to an Avigilon Control Center system.
Optional: In the Device properties section, perform any of the following actions:
Set Battery life extender to On.
On supported devices, enabling this toggle extends the device battery lifetime by reducing the maximum device charge.

Note: Battery life extender should only be set to On if users regularly leave devices charging in their docks for 24 hours or longer.
In the Default Media Owner field, enter the name of the user who will become the owner of the media that do not have an owner.
Set Reduced Power Consumption Mode to On.
Note: Not all devices support this feature.
When enabled, the device is shut down after charging is complete and the device is in an idle state.

You must manually undock or turn on the device again to return it to operation. The device cannot be assigned when turned off. Enabling this feature can impact the management of large device fleets.

Optional: In the Shift-long field trips section, set Enable shift-long field trips to On.
If set to On, a device assigned to a user has an affinity with that user once it is redocked in the middle of a shift.
This means that if an operator redocks their device mid-shift and then undocks it later in the shift, VideoManager automatically assigns the same device to them, unless one of the following conditions is met:

The device is fully charged.
The device is manually unassigned on VideoManager.
The shift ends, as determined by the number of hours entered into the Maximum shift length field.
Note: This function does not apply to devices that have been assigned with permanent issue or permanent allocation because VideoManager associates the user to the device permanently anyway.
Optional: In the Footage signing section, set Enable footage signing to On.
You can enable footage signing if you have also created or imported a certificate authority from the Device Certificate Authorities section.
If Footage signing is set to On, each device is provided with a certificate that they will use to sign media files. When the media files are downloaded, VideoManager checks if the signatures of media files match the certificates of the devices, and if the certificates can be trusted.

Note: This action only works if a certificate authority has been created or imported into VideoManager. If you have not created or imported a certificate authority, this action does nothing.
For more information, see Performing Device Certificate Authorities Actions.

Optional: In the Device Maintenance section, perform any of the following actions:
If you set Enable maintenance on dock to On, maintenance is performed on supported devices when they are docked.
If you set Enable scheduled maintenance to On, the Scheduled maintenance time field appears where you can set the time for daily scheduled maintenance.
Optional: In the Device profiles section, from the Default device profile family drop-down list, select the device profile that should appear first by default in the Device Profiles section.
Alternatively, the device profile that you visited last becomes the default device profile .

Note: If an access control key is deleted while devices associated with it are still in the field, those devices appear as Locked when redocked and all media that was not already downloaded to VideoManager is permanently inaccessible, unless you have exported the access control key and can import it into VideoManager again.
Click  Delete key.
Set Confirm that you want to delete this key to On.
Click Delete.
Performing Device Certificate Authorities Actions
VideoManager can verify media that has been downloaded from devices, to check whether the media has been tampered with and whether it comes from a trusted source such as a genuine Motorola Solutions device. In order for this feature to function, you must first create or import a certificate authority into VideoManager, which signs the certificates issued to devices. You must then enable media signing.

Note: If there is an existing certificate authority on VideoManager, the newly created or imported certificate authority replaces it as the signing certificate authority, that is VideoManager uses the new certificate authority to issue certificates to new devices from now on. However, devices that already have certificates created from the old certificate authority continue to sign files using their old certificates, and previously downloaded files contain signatures that refer to the old certificate authority. For this reason, the old certificate authority is retained so that VideoManager can use it to validate the media files from these devices. If devices should be issued new certificates based on the new certificate authority, the administrator must factory reset them.
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Devices pane.
Click the  Device Certificate Authorities section.
Perform one of the following actions:
Option	Actions
Creating new certificate authorities	
Click  Create new device certificate authority.
VideoManager automatically populates the Common Name field with the public address + root CA. You can change the name, if you want.

Optional:In the Organisation field, enter the name of your organisation.

Optional:In the Organisational unit field, enter the name of the department that the certificate authority is for.
For example, Research and Development

Click Create.
Importing existing certificate authorities	
Click  Import device certificate authority.
Click Choose file.
Note: Any imported certificate must be a certificate authority and must be accompanied by a private key. Both the certificate and private key must be packaged as a PKCS#12 file. Certificates issued by public certificate authorities are unlikely to be suitable for import. Usually, if you want to use your own certificate authority, you must create it yourself.
Select the certificate and click Open.
Click OK.
Perform the following actions:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Devices pane.
Click the  Device Settings section.
Scroll down to the Footage signing section.
Set Enable footage signing to On.
For more information, see Configuring Device Settings.
From now on, all upgraded devices that are docked are issued with signing certificates. All media files downloaded from these devices are accompanied by a digital signature: VideoManager will check if the downloaded media files match their signatures and that the certificate associated with the signature is trusted by VideoManager. You can check whether the media files match this certificate from the Media tab.
For more information, see Viewing and Editing Media File Properties.

Exporting Certificate Authorities
If devices are moved from one instance of VideoManager to another, you should export the certificate authorities of those devices from the original instance and import it into the new instance. This action ensures that media files from those devices can have their signatures checked against the original certificate. Only the public part of the certificate authority is exported, so there is no security risk from importing these certificates into a less trusted system.
Procedure:
On the old instance of VideoManager, navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Devices pane.
Click the  Device Certificate Authorities section.
Next to the certificate authority to be exported, click  View Certificate Authority.
Click  Export device certificate authority.

Creating Network Profiles
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Connectivity pane.
Click the  Network Profiles section.
Click  Create network profile.
In the Name field, enter a name for the network profile.
If you want the network profile to be the default, set Default profile to On.
If set to On, devices assigned with single issue via RFID and Permanent allocation will automatically use this network profile.
If you want a user's user-specific WiFi networks to be added to the network profile, set User-specific networks to Yes.
User-specific WiFi networks are networks that only appear on a user's session of VideoManager. This action is useful if multiple users have their own individual mobile hotspots that should only be used by devices assigned to them.
For more information, see Creating User-Specific WiFi Networks.

The following sections appear:  VT50/VT100 and  V200/VB400/V500.
If User-specific networks is enabled, configure the following settings:
If Enable streaming is set to On, users with appropriate permissions can live stream media over VideoManager from devices in the field.
Note: This option controls only a single network for a V200. If there is more than one network created for a VB400 or V500 and at least one of them has Enable streaming set to On, streaming will be available for all networks.
V200/VB400/V500 only: If Enable video offloading is set to On, media that has been recorded on the device will be offloaded to VideoManager over the WiFi networks within this user-specific network profile.
Note: This option controls only a single network for a V200. If there is more than one network created for a VB400 or V500 and at least one of them has Enable video offloading set to On, offloading will be available for all networks.
If Enable docking is set to On, devices offload media and are fully manageable in VideoManager when charging and connected to WiFi. Enabling this option facilitates wireless media offload and enables remote management functions such as firmware upgrades, device assignment, or configuration changes.
Note: Factory reset is not supported at the moment for V200 cameras. Firmware V200 version V25.4 is required to support this functionality.
Configure WiFi networks to the network profile by clicking  Add network and performing any of the following actions:
Note: Unlike user-specific WiFi networks, these WiFi networks can be used by all devices that have this network profile assigned to them, regardless of their operator.
In the Network name (SSID) field, enter the SSID of the WiFi network.
From the Security type drop-down list, select the security type of the WiFi network.
In the Passphrase field, enter the passphrase for the WiFi network.
Usually, you can find these credentials on the bottom of the WiFi router.

From the Band drop-down list, select which frequencies the devices should attempt to connect to.
The options are as follows:

Any makes devices connect to both 2.4GHz and 5GHz frequencies.
2.4GHz only makes all devices connect to 2.4GHz frequencies.
5GHz only makes devices connect to 5GHz frequencies.
Set Disconnect on low signal to On.
If set to On, devices disconnect from the network if it has a low signal. The user can configure for how long the device must be connected to the weak signal, after which the device disconnects.

If you want to enable devices to connect to hidden networks, set Hidden network to On.
Note: Hidden network should only be set to On if the networks within a network profile are hidden networks.
Perform the configurations as described in 8.
If multiple networks should be contained within the network profile, repeat 9 until all the necessary networks have been added.
Note: You can prioritise the networks by using  Move up and  Move down. Devices will attempt to connect to the first network shown in the list, while the last network in the list will only be used if all the other networks are unavailable.
V500 only: In the Mobile networks section, perform any of the following actions:
Set Enable LTE to Yes.
Note:
Assigning a network profile to a device that has both WiFi and LTE enabled will not send the WiFi configuration. The device can only use WiFi if it is assigned with a network profile that has LTE disabled.

If you want to enable devices to be able to live stream media over LTE networks in this network profile, set Enable streaming to On.
If you want the media that has been recorded on the device to be offloaded to VideoManager over the LTE networks within this network profile, set Enable wireless offload to On.
If you have configured device profiles so that the device can place bookmarks in a media file, then only bookmarked media files are downloaded over the LTE networks.

If you have not configured the device profiles, then all media files are downloaded over the LTE networks when the device is connected to power.

For more information, see Performing Device Profiles Actions and Device Profiles.

Creating Media Fields
VideoManager comes with some built-in media fields, which enable users to categorise media files as they are being edited. Administrators can also create their own media fields to reflect the unique needs of their organisation.
Prerequisites:

Before you create new media fields, you can create validators, which define how information entered into media fields must be formatted, for example, as a UK postcode.
For more information, see Creating and Applying Validators.

If the new media field should show users a different display name based on their session language, you should change the language for your own session before you create the field so that it does not match the server language of VideoManager. This action can be done from either the account menu or the  Language section.
For more information, see Configuring the Language on VideoManager.

Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Media and Playback pane.
Click the  Media Fields section.
Click  Create field.
In the Identifier field, enter an identifier for the media field.
The identifier should be all lowercase, and unique.
In the Display name field, enter a display name for the media field.
The display name is what the media field is called in the VideoManager UI.
Note: An optional second display name field appears if your session language does not currently match the server language of VideoManager. The field enables you to enter a display name for the field in both languages. If the display name should be set in more than two languages, you must complete the field, save it, then change your session to the third language and edit the field.
From the Type drop-down list, select the type of a media field to be created:
Name	Description
Text	In this media field, users can enter text related to the media file, which is useful if users need to search for a specific phrase or word, such as Assault, Arrest, and more.
Text List	In this media field, users can select one or more texts related to the media file.
Date	In this media field, users can select a date related to the media file.
Date & Time	In this media field, users can select a date and time related to the media file.
Drop down	In this media field, users can select an option from a drop-down list related to the media file.
Check box	In this media field, users can either select or unselect a check box related to the media file.
URL	In this media field, users can enter a URL related to the media file.
Computed	In this media field, users can create URLs from previously created media fields. Administrators can also configure computed fields to appear, and change their appearance, based on how other media fields are populated.
Tag List	In this media field, users can select one or more tags related to the media file.
Note: The type of the media field cannot be changed later.
Optional: If you do not want users to be able to save a media file unless they populate the field, set Mandatory to Yes.
Optional: From the Display timeout drop-down list, select how long this field should stay on the screen before it disappears.

Any users in the selected access group are able to view and edit the media field when creating and editing media files.
If all users should be able to utilise the media field when creating and editing media files, you can select Public.

Computed fields do not need to have the same permission groups as the other media fields that determine whether they appear or not. For example, if only some administrators should be able to populate the review-status field with sensitive information, but all users should be able to see the more general reviewed-already computed field, review-status could be set to Access Group One, while reviewed-already could be set to Public.

Optional: If you have selected Text from the drop-down type list, if you want in-vehicle devices to capture event information, set Is Event Tag? to Yes.
From the Column width drop-down list, select how wide the column of the media field should appear in media search results.

Set Identiﬁer to <title>.
Set Is Event Tag? to On.
Configuring User-Defined Field Layouts
When a user searches for incidents or media files, they are presented with a table showing all relevant incidents or media files in the  Search Incidents or  Search Media pane. Administrators can configure which user-defined fields, if any, are shown in this table when the  List view is selected.
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Perform one of the following actions:
Navigate to  Media and Playback →  Media Fields.
Navigate to Incidents →  Incident Fields.
Click  Field layouts.
You are presented with the following sections:
Small tables shows which user-defined fields are displayed in a small table, for example, on a mobile phone.
Medium tables shows which user-defined fields are displayed in a medium table, for example, on a tablet.
Large tables shows which user-defined fields are displayed in a large table, for example, on a computer.
In the relevant section, click .
From the drop-down list, select which user-defined fields should be added to the table.
The user-defined fields are added to the bottom of the list.
If necessary, rearrange the fields in the table by grabbing the left-hand side of the relevant field and dragging it to the desired location in the list.
Click Save changes.
Exporting and Importing Media Playback Reason Fields
If you have multiple instances of VideoManager, you can transfer a copy of your media playback reason fields from one instance to another.
Procedure:
In the original instance of VideoManager, navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Media and Playback pane.
Click the  Media Playback Reason Fields section.
Click  Export.
The media playback reason fields are saved to the default download location of your PC.
In the new instance of VideoManager (or a site, if User-defined Fields has been set to Off in the  Metadata/Footage Replication section), navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Media and Playback pane.
Click the  Media Playback Reason Fields section.
Click  Import.
Select the previously downloaded media playback reason fields.
Click Import.
Alternatively, if you want to import all of your media playback reason fields simultaneously, you can do so from the  Import/Export System Config section of the  System pane, in the Admin tab.
For more information, see Exporting and Importing the Configuration of VideoManager.

Creating and Applying Validators
You can control the format of information entered into media playback reason fields. This action can be done through the creation of validators, which can be configured to accept certain patterns and reject others, for example, a UK postcode or a URL.
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Media and Playback pane.
Click the  Media Playback Reason Fields section.
Click  Edit validators.
Click  Create validator.
In the Identifier field, enter a unique name for the validator.
In the Description field, enter the text which users should see when populating a media playback reason field.
The description should detail the format to which the media playback reason field should adhere.
In the Pattern field, enter the pattern of the validator.
This action should be done utilising regular expressions.
Optional: If you want the validator to ignore the case of the text entered into the media playback reason field, set Case insensitive to On.
If set to Off, the case of the text entered into the media playback reason field must match that of the Pattern field.
Optional: If you want to test the validator, in the Test text field, enter the example text.
VideoManager determines whether the example text would be accepted by the validator or not.
Click Confirm.
Postrequisites:
After validators have been created, they must be individually applied to media playback reason fields to ensure that the media playback reason fields obey the patterns detailed in the validators. This action must be done during media playback reason field creation. Validators cannot be edited after a media playback reason field has been created.

For more information, see Creating Media Playback Reason Fields.

Reordering Media Playback Reason Fields
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Media and Playback pane.
Click the  Media Playback Reason Fields section.
Click   Reorder fields.
Grab the left-hand side of the relevant media field and drag it to the desired location in the list.
Click Confirm.
When users edit a media file, the media playback reason fields to be populated are presented in the same order which has been configured here.
Creating Media Playback Reason Fields
Media playback reason fields are used in conjunction with the playback policy. When a user views a media file, which is a certain number of days old, VideoManager prompts them to give a reason as to why they are rewatching it. The user must then enter their answer in the previously created media playback reason field.
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Media and Playback pane.
Click the  Media Playback Reason Fields section.
The process for creating media playback reason fields is the same as the process for creating incident fields, but with fewer options. Administrators can create as many media playback reason fields as necessary.

For more information, see Creating Incident Fields.

Postrequisites:

After you have created media playback reason fields, you must configure the playback policy to prompt users to complete these fields after a certain period of time.

For more information, see Configuring the Playback Policy.

You can perform actions on these media playback reason fields from the Media Playback Reason Fields pane. You can:

Export media playback reason fields from one instance of VideoManager, and import them into another instance.
For more information, see Exporting and Importing Media Playback Reason Fields.

Reorder media playback reason fields, which affects how media playback reason fields are presented.
For more information, see Reordering Media Playback Reason Fields.

Configuring Media File Exports
You can configure VideoManager so that it automatically copies media files to an external location as soon as they have been downloaded from the corresponding devices. The media files are still available on VideoManager like normal.
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Media and Playback pane.
Click the  Media/File Exports section.
Set Auto file export to On.
In the File path field, enter the file path to which media files should automatically be sent.
You can add fields to this path that correlate with the properties of the media files. You can do so by selecting the relevant fields from the Add Field drop-down list. You must separate each field with a slash.
These fields send the media file to sub-folders based on, for example, the operator who recorded the media file, or the serial number of the device.

Note: If the specified folders do not already exist for this path, they are created as soon as the media files are automatically exported.
Optional: To reset the path, click  Reset to Default.
The path is reset to C:\pss-file-exports\<DEV_SERIAL>\<REC_DATE_TIME> .
In the File name field, enter the name for individual media files after they have been exported.
You can add fields to this name that correlate with the properties of the media files, in addition to plaintext. You can do so by selecting the relevant fields from the Add Field drop-down list. You must separate each field with a slash.
Note: VideoManager does not save the configuration of the File name field unless it generates a unique name for every exported media file. You can click  for more information about how to guarantee unique names.
Optional: To reset the name, click  Reset to Default.
The path is reset to <DEV_SERIAL>-<REC_DATE_TIME>.<FILE_INDEX> .
Click Save settings.
Configuring the Media List
You can customize how media files are presented by default, for both users' personal dashboards and the Media tab.
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Media and Playback pane.
Click the  Media List section.
From the Media display mode drop-down list, select how media files on users' dashboards are presented.
The options are List or Gallery.
From the Media sort order drop-down list, select how media files in the Media tab are ordered.
The options are Recording date, Recording date (least recent), or Date added.
This action sets the default in the Media tab for all users. However, users with the correct permissions can override the default for their individual session. For more information, see Changing Viewing Options.

Click Save settings.
Configuring Import Profiles
Import profiles determine how media files can be imported into VideoManager. They can also be used in tandem with media fields to insert media file metadata into VideoManager as the media files are imported.
Prerequisites:
Create at least one media field, which can be populated by users when they import media files.

For more information, see Creating Media Fields.

Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Media and Playback pane.
Click the  Import Profiles section.
Click  Create new profile.
In the Name field, enter a name for the import profile.
In the Description field, enter a description for the import profile.
The description tells other users on VideoManager what this profile controls. For example, which media fields are automatically populated.
In the Profile field, enter the profile.
The most simple profile populates certain media fields for a media file automatically, when it is imported. This means that the user does not need to do it manually after the media file is imported. The JSON format is as follows:
"properties": "<name of media field>": "<value of media field>"
For example, if you created a media field called vehicle-type, any media files imported with this import profile would have their vehicle-type field populated with car.

"properties": "vehicle-type": "car"
To automatically populate multiple media fields, enter a comma between the fields as shown in the following example.

"properties": "vehicle-type": "car","category": "arrest"
Another simple profile enables users to populate the media fields for a media file, before the media file is imported. The JSON properties are as follows:

promptedFields – The user importing the media file can optionally populate these media fields before the media file is imported.
promptedMandatory – The user importing the media file must populate these media fields before the media file can be imported.
The JSON format is as follows:

"promptedFields": "<name of media field>"
In the following configuration, users would be prompted to populate the import-reason media field when importing their media file.

"promptedFields": "import-reason"
In the following configuration, users would have to populate the import-reason media field before they could import their media file.

"promptedMandatory": "import-reason"
Note: For more complex import profile configurations, you should contact Motorola Solutions Support.
Verify that Automatic import it set to Off.
Automatic import should be set to Off unless specified by Motorola Solutions Support.
When set to Off, the user must choose the profile from the drop-down list when manually importing files from the Media tab.

For more information, see Importing Media Files.

Export-Import Feedback Mechanism
An export-import feedback mechanism manages the secure transfer of sensitive data from System A to System B, without compromising system access constraints.

Overview
Consider a police officer who has collected crucial video evidence during an investigation. This evidence, stored in their VideoManager system (System A), needs to be accessed by a court official (System B). However, the court official does not have access to the police officer's system due to institutional restrictions or data protection concerns.

The process starts when the police officer creates an incident in System A, attaching the necessary video media. This incident is then designated for export, leading to the data being transferred into a shared storage that both systems can access.

In parallel, System B has an automated import process that continuously scans the shared storage for new exports from System A. Upon detecting new data, System B initiates processing of the files. Once completed, System B generates a confirmation file that includes important information like the export job signature and a URL for direct access to the video. This file is written into another shared location accessible by System A.

Simultaneously, System A maintains an automated import process that monitors for "import confirmations" from System B. When such a confirmation is ingested, System A updates the associated original export job with the URL provided by System B, and notifies the user who initiated the export, completing the data exchange process.

Export-Import Feedback Mechanism

Configuration Requirements
There are three configuration elements required for System A to automatically export to System B:

System A requires an export profile to write the exported files to some mutually accessible location. The signature of the export job must be included in metadata.
System B requires an automatic import profile to monitor the location being used for System A's exports. This import profile must also define the location of the commit file and the location and contents of the confirm file used by System A. The confirm file must contain the export job signature to allow System A to confirm when the process completes. Both commit and confirm files must be written to a mutually accessible location, which does not have to be the same as for the System A exports. For more information, see Importing System Configuration for Automatic Imports.
System A must have an automatic import profile, which will be monitored and is used to import the confirmation files generated by System B. This profile does not create any commit/confirm files. System B will use the export job signature written into the confirm file by System A in order to complete the export-import process. For more information, see Exporting System Configuration for Import Confirmations.
Importing System Configuration for Automatic Imports
The importing VideoManager must be configured to automatically detect and import exported files from another exporting VideoManager. This requires configuring an import profile to detect when a new export is ready to be imported by the importing VideoManager, and creating the files used by the exporting VideoManager to verify when the import has completed. Once an automatic import profile is created, VideoManager uses it to automatically detect and import any files matching the given profile and at the specified, to be monitored, location.
To configure an import profile, see Configuring Import Profiles.

Field values
The key fields for configuring an automatic export are:

Profile is a JSON file defining properties used for the import of files.

It requires specification of a monitorPath. The importing VideoManager observes this location, and all subdirectories, to detect when the exporting VideoManager places new exports within it, which is indicated by a *.exportcompletion file being written.

An archivePath must also be defined. When cleanupMode is "MOVE", imported files are archived at that location.

The filters property is used to exclude any files not to be imported, including the exportcompletion file. For more information, see Exporting System Configuration for Import Confirmations.

Commit file path is a FreeMarker template which, when rendered, defines the absolute path for writing the commit file.
Both the commit and confirm file paths will be partially rewritten as part of creating the files, such that the commit/confirm files are placed in a subdirectory identified by the import signature. For example, if a path is configured at c:\test\READY, the actual file will be written to c:\test\{exportSignature}\READY.

Confirmation file path is a FreeMarker template defining the absolute path for writing the confirmation file. The filename should end with the extension exportcompletion.
Confirmation file contents is a FreeMarker template defining the contents of the confirmation file. The FreeMarker should resolve to JSON and include a mapping for the exportSignature, which is used to indicate completion of the import to the exporting system.
Automatic import should be set to On to allow VideoManager to apply the new profile towards detecting and importing new files in the monitored location(s).
Example of the Import Profile
In the following example, the profile will monitor the path c:\\test_auto_import\\export_to for any new subdirectories to import. Completed imports, due to "cleanupMode": "MOVE", will be moved into the archivePath.

{
  "owner":admin",
  "cleanupMode": "MOVE",
  "archivePath": "C:\\test_auto_import\\import_archive\\{name}",
  "moni torPath": "C:\\test_auto_import\\export_to",
  "maxRetries": 3,
  "filters": [
    {
      "pattern": "*.exportconfirmation"
    }
  ]
}
Example of the FreeMarker Template for Commit File Path

C:\\test_auto_import\\import_confirmation\\${exportJobSignature}_confirmation\\READY
Example of the Confirmation Path

C:\\test_auto_import\\import_confirmation\\${exportJobSignature}_confirmation\\export.exportcompletion
Example of the Commit File Contents

{
  "exportSignature": "${exportJobSignature}"<#if (media[0])??>,
  "url": "${publicWebUri}/app/videos/${media[0].mediaId}/info"</#if>
}
Note: The above example uses FreeMarker conditionals to only render the URL if there is a media item in the import to link to. If so, the IRL is the first media file in the list.
Corresponding Exporting System Profile
For reference, the matching profile in the exporting system is as follows:

Profile

{
  "owner": "admin",
  "requires": "READY",
  "cleanupMode": "DELETE",
  "archivePath": "C:\\test_auto_import\\export_confirm_archive",
  "monitorPath": "C:\\test_auto_import\\import_confirmation",
  "monitorDetectionPattern": ".*confirmation",
  "maxRetries": 3,
  "filters": [
    {
      "pattern": ". *exportcompletion"
    }
  ]
}
The exporting system auto-import profile does not require values to be set for the commit path, confirm path or confirm contents.

Further References
FreeMarker Template Field Values

The import process creates a key:value map, subsequently used to populate variables within the FreeMarker templates defined in the import profile for commit file path, confirmation file path, and confirmation file contents.

When the import contains non-sidecar metadata files, the key:value entries within will also be extracted and exposed for use in rendering FreeMarker.

The import must provide an *.exportconfirmation file in the JSON format, used to determine the exportJobSignature. The import will fail if the file is not present, as the value is necessary to the file that notifies the exporting system when the import job has completed.

Model Fields
Name	Type	Purpose/Meaning
publicWebUri	String	URI for VM public address
importId	String	ID of the import job
importSignature	String	Signature of the import job
exportJobSignature	String	Signature of the export job, provided by the *.exportconfirmation file used to trigger the import
sourcePath	String	Defines path to the source of the import
jobCompletionTimeStamp	Date	Time when the import job was completed
importProfile	Map<String, String>	Information on the profile used to perform the import
The value is a map with keys name and description

media	List	List of maps, each with data for the imported media files
metadata	Map<String, Map> (filename to map)	Contents of any metadata files, that is *.properties or *.json files included in the import, and the key:value entries within
incidents	Map<String, lncidentTemplateModel> (incident ID to lncidentTemplateModel)	Incidents associated with the import media, if created
Example

The following example is for FreeMarker to display a large number of the model fields.

{
  "importId": "${importId}",
  "publicWebUri": "${publicWebUri}",
  "importSignature": "${importSignature}",
  "exportJobSignature": "${exportJobSignature}",
  "jobCompletionTimeStamp": "${jobCompletionTimeStamp?date}"
  "sourcePath": ${sourcePath},
  "importProfile":
  {
    "name": "${importProfile.name}"
  },
  "metadata":
  [
    <#list metadata as name,entry>
    {
            "name": "${name}",
            <#list data?keys as key,value>
            "${key}": "${value}"
            </#list>
    }<#if name?has_next>,</#if>
    </#list>
    ],
    "firstIncident": "${incidents?values[0].id}"
    "allIncidents":
    [
        <#list incidents as name, entry>
        {
           "id": "${entry.id}",
           "signature": "${entry.signature}",
           "displaySignature": "${entry.display5ignature}",
            "basestationID": "${entry.basestationID}"
         }<#if name?has_next>,</#if>
         </#list>
    ]
}
Exporting System Configuration for Import Confirmations
To confirm that the export was successfully imported, the importing system creates a subfolder in a predetermined location, populating it with a special metadata file.

The auto-importer of the exporting system scans this location for new folders matching a pattern specified in the profile, ingests the metadata, and completes the export, while populating the "url" of the export job.

Generation of Import Confirmations
exportcompletion File Naming

The metadata file should have the file extension .exportcompletion. The rest of the filename is not important to the importer, but may usefully contain other information about the export or importing system.

exportcompletion File Format

The confirmation file is in the form of a JSON text file and must have the following properties:

exportSignature is the signature of the export you want to confirm the import of.
url is the URL in the destination system for this export.
An example of the file content:

{
"exportSignature": "abc123",
"url": "http://server.host:9080/link/to/media/12345"
}
Generation of Subfolders

The contents of the subfolder should also include a "requires" file that triggers the importer to begin processing the folder. The file should be created in the subfolder after the creation of the .exportcompletion file.

It is important that a separate file is used for this purpose, otherwise the importer could attempt to read the .exportcompletion file before it has been fully written to the subfolder.

The following example shows a possible layout of a generated subfolder:

export_abc123_20230713162000_confirmed/
abc123.exportcompletion
READY
Ingestion of Import Confirmations
The export system runs an automatic importer to scan for import confirmations from the other system, which requires the configuration of an automatic import profile.

Import Profile

On the export system, you must create an automatic import profile. The profile should include "requires", "monitorDetectionPattern", and "filters" properties.

The following is an example of such import profile:

{
  "owner": "USER",
  "requires": "READY",
  "cleanupMode": "MOVE",
  "archivePath": "/import_confirmation_archives/{name}-{sign}",
  "monitorPath": "/import_confirmations",
  "monitorDetectionPattern": ".*confirmed",
  "maxRetries": 3,
  "filters": [
    {
      "pattern": "*.exportcompletion"
    }
  ]
}
owner is a valid system user.
requires is the filename to detect in the subfolder, which triggers the import. In the example above, an appearance of a file called READY triggers the importer to process the subfolder.
monitorDetectionPattern is an expression which matches the name of the subfolder containing the confirmation data. In the example above, the importer detects any subfolder with a suffix of "confirmed". For example, a subfolder named export_abc123_20230713162000_confirmed would be presumed to contain the relevant data, but a subfolder named export_abc123_20230713162000 would not, and would be ignored.
filters shoud be set to use the pattern *.exportcompletion, which will allow the importer to correctly identify and process the confirmation file.
As usual for automatic imports, other properties can be configured :

cleanupMode specifies what should happen to the imported directory after completion of the import. For a standard direct mode import, the default is NONE, that is, tile directory is left where it is. For autoimports, the default is RENAME, which attempts to rename the directory and applies any formatting defined in archivePath. If the renamed directory already exists, the import job signature is usually applied as a suffix.
Other options are MOVE and DELETE. DELETE attempts to completely remove the directory while MOVE attempts to move the directory to a location specified by archivePath.

archivePath is a location and/or some filename formatting to be applied during the cleanup phase of an import. Tags include {name} for the original directory name, {sign} for the import job signature, {year} for the current year (2018), {month} for the current month (05), and {day} for the current day (03}.
monitorPath is the main directory the importer monitors for new import subfolders.
Configuring VideoManager for Export Confirmation
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Incidents pane.
Click the  Incident Exports section.
Perform one of the following actions:
In the Export Profiles section, click  Create new export profile.
For more information, see Creating DVD Export Profiles, Creating MP4 Export Profiles, or Creating Evidence Export Profiles.

In the Export Profiles section, next to the relevant profile, click  Edit export profile.
From the Export location drop-down list, select Directory and set a path.
Ensure that the path has write access and is visible for both systems, including export/import grid workers.
Set Await export confirmation to Yes.
Note: Enabling this setting without setting up a confirmation mechanism prevents exports from completing.
Optional: If you want the export to include an incident metadata file, in the Export metadata section, set Add metadata file to On.
To create an export, select the incident with some clips in it and select Export Incident.
For more information, see Searching Incidents.
The export begins. You can find your export in the My Exports pane in the Incidents tab. The export displays the Awaiting Confirmation status until the importing system acknowledges that the export was successfully imported.
Once the importing system acknowledges a successful import, the export completes and the status changes to Ready.

If available, you can copy the destination URL by clicking  Copy destination URL next to the export.

You can also access the URL from the Destination URL section in the Export details page.

Testing the Export-Import Feedback Mechanism
Prerequisites:

Ensure that you have two VideoManager systems.
Ensure that the shared storage is visible by the two instances.
It can be a folder in the local machine.

Create parent folders manually.
Note: The path set in monitorPath, archivePath, commit file path, and confirm file path must exist. You must create the necessary folders to make the paths available to the systems.
Procedure:
Configure an Export Evidence export profile. For more information, see Configuring VideoManager for Export Confirmation.
Configure an import profile by performing the following actions:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Media and Playback pane.
Click the  Import Profiles section.
Click  Create new profile.
Set the profile name and the profile details.
For more information, see Configuring Import Profiles.
For example:

{
    "owner": "{vmgr-user}",
    "requires": "READY",
    "cleanupMode": "MOVE",
    "archivePath": "D:\\SharedData\\confirmations_archive\\{name}-{sign}",
    "monitorPath": "D:\\SharedData\\confirmations\\",
    "maxRetries": 3,
    "filters": [
    {
        "pattern": "*.exportcompletion"
    }
  ]
}
Set Automatic import to On.
Click Save Profile.
The export system (System A) scans any subfolders under D:\\SharedData\\confirmations\\ for a commit file called READY and imports any file with extension exportcompletion.
Configure an import profile by performing the following actions:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Media and Playback pane.
Click the  Import Profiles section.
Click  Create new profile.
Set the profile name and the profile details.
For more information, see Configuring Import Profiles.
For example:

{
    "owner": "{vmgr-user}",
    "requires": "Commit.txt",
    "cleanupMode": "MOVE",
    "archivePath": "D:\\SharedData\\exports_archive\\{name}-{sign}",
    "monitorPath": "D:\\SharedData\\exports",
    "maxRetries": 3
}
Enter the commit file path and name.
For example:
D:\\SharedData\\confirmations\\READY

or

D:/SharedData/confirmations/READY

Enter the confirmation file name with exportcompletion as the extension.
For example:
D:\\SharedData\\confirmations\\{filename}.exportcompletion

or

D:/SharedData/confirmations/{filename}.exportcompletion

Set the confirmation file contents.
Note: It is important to have at least the export job signature. Otherwise, it will not work.
For example:

{
    "exportSignature": "${exportJobSignature}"
    <#if media??>
      ,
      "url": "${publicWebUri}/app/videos/${media[0].mediaId}/info"
    </#if>
}
Set Automatic import to On.
Click Save Profile.
The import system scans any subfolders under D:\\SharedData\\exports and imports any contents inside them. After the import is successful, it generates the commit and confirmation files to let the exporting system know that the import was successful.
The content of the confirmation file contains a url which is the URL of the importing system. The URL is visible in the exporting system. For more information, see Configuring VideoManager for Export Confirmation.

Note: In some scenarios, the shared space is located in the network. If this is the case, the absolute path will be in the form of either \\\\vmware-host\\Shared Folders\\ or //vmware-host/Shared Folders/SharedFolder.
Configuring the Playback Policy
You can control whether, after a certain time, media files cannot be viewed on VideoManager without the user first recording their reason for viewing, and whether all media files on VideoManager have a watermark when played back.
Prerequisites:
Create a media playback reason field.

This action enables users to provide their reason for rewatching media files. If a media playback reason field is not created after the playback policy is configured, then users must still acknowledge that they are rewatching a media file after a certain amount of time has elapsed, but VideoManager does not prompt them for a reason.

For more information, see Creating Media Playback Reason Fields.

Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Media and Playback pane.
Click the  Playback Policy section.
If you want users to record their reason for watching a media file after a set number of days, set Enable playback reason auditing to On.
In the Require media playback reason section, enter the number of days since the media file was recorded, after which a user must give a reason for watching it.
From the Protection mode drop-down list, select one of the following options:
If you want to enable authenticated and authorised users to use download tools, select Disabled.
If you want to protect videos against download tools running on modern web browsers only, select Default protection.
If you want to protect videos against download tools running on modern web browsers and reject play attempts from older web browsers, select Strict protection.
Note: If you select Strict protection, all users must be on modern web browsers in order to play videos.
Click Save settings.
Configuring Player
You can select the default quality at which media files are played in the VideoManager player.
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Media and Playback pane.
Click the  Playback Policy section.
From the Default quality drop-down list, select the default media file quality.
The options are as follows: Highest, Standard, Low, Lower, Very low, and Lowest.
Click Save settings.
Any changes come into effect only when you log on again or when you refresh the page.
Users who have the Control playback quality permission enabled can override this default when they watch media files from the Media tab. Users without the permission must watch all media files from the Media tab in the selected quality.

For more information, see Viewing Media Files.

Configuring Playback Watermarks
You can customise the playback video by adding different watermarks in different positions.

Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Media and Playback pane.
Click the  Playback Watermark section.
Set Enable playback watermarking to On.
The Standard watermark and Tiled watermark panes display.
The tiled watermark displays diagonally over the video.

Depending on the watermark, you can configure different parameters.

In the Text box, enter the text to be displayed.
Next to the Text box, click  and from the drop-down list, select which live field you want to add to the text.
The options are: Playback signature, Username, Date, and Time.
From the Size drop-down list, select the desired size of the watermark.
From the Background opacity drop-down list, select the desired opacity level of the watermark background.
From the Font opacity drop-down list, select the desired opacity level of the font.
From the Text colour drop-down list, select the desired colour of the text.
From the Position drop-down list, select where the watermark should be displayed.
Optional: To delete the watermark, next to the watermark to be deleted, click .
Optional: To add more standard watermarks, click  Add watermark.
Click Save settings.
Configuring Thumbnails
You can utilise markdown to create a phrase that will appear in the place of a thumbnail for media files that were imported without a built-in thumbnail.

The following procedure describes how to edit the custom thumbnails for imported media files.

Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Media and Playback pane.
Click the  Thumbnails section.
Edit any of the following fields:
Audio file expression dictates the default thumbnail for audio media files.
PDF file expression dictates the default thumbnail for PDF media files.
Other files expression dictates the default thumbnail for other types of media files.
There are some thumbnail-specific functions that you can input. The functions are as follows:

\n creates a line break.
+ strings multiple values together.
text() returns a string representation of whatever input it is given. This could be a number, or dates.
formatInterval() rearranges a number of seconds into a more readable format.
For example, formatInterval(100) would return 1m40s.

Note: The expression entered is formatted with markdown.
Click Save settings.
Configuring Video Metadata Overlay Settings
VideoManager enables you to add metadata to recorded media. This metadata is stored in the media file and can be displayed in an overlay during playback and export. These settings apply to all media files recorded by devices whose device profiles have been configured to include metadata.

Note: GPS performance may vary depending on location, usage, and other conditions.
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Media and Playback pane.
Click the  Video Metadata Overlay Settings section.
To add a metadata element to the media file overlay, scroll down to the bottom of the pane, and from the Add element drop-down list, select an element.
Note: The order in which you choose the metadata elements determines the order in which the elements appear when a media file is played (left to right).
Not all devices display all options.

The element options are as follows:

Name	Description
Device serial number	The serial number of the device on which the media was recorded.
Operator name	The name of the operator who recorded the media.
You can configure how many characters of the name should be visible over the media file, and how many spaces should be added to "pad" the name out to a minimum size.

Date and time	You can configure the following:
Timezone
UTC – Greenwich Mean Time, but without adjustments for day-light savings time
Local Time – taken from the server of VideoManager
Time & date format sets the format for date and time metadata. The options are as follows:
ISO standard 8601 – If selected, the time and date is presented in an internationally standardised manner.
Custom – If selected, more options are presented, as detailed below:
Time display – 24-Hour Display (for example, 19:00) or 12-Hour Display With AM/PM Markers (for example, 12AM)
Timezone display – None, Show time zone offset In hours:minutes (for example, +01:00), or Show time zone name (for example, GMT)
Date format – DD/MM/YY, MM/DD/YY, YY/MM/DD, DD-MM-YY, MM-DD-YY, or YY-MM-DD
Years format – YY (for example, '19'), or YYYY (for example, '2019')
Frame counter	Shows the user which frame is currently being shown in the playback viewer.
Recording time	Shows the length of the recording.
You can configure whether the recording time should start from when the operator pressed the record, or when the first frame was actually recorded. If you select the former option, any pre-recorded media appears as negative time in the metadata overlay, for example, -00:23:45.

Pre/Post-record marker	Indicates which part of the media file has been pre-recorded or post-recorded, if any.
Text	You can enter text to give more information about the device, operator, and more.
Unlike other elements, you can add as many Text elements as necessary.

GPS	Displays the latitude and longitude of the device.
You can enable the following settings:

If you set Include speed to On, the speed of the device is displayed in meters per second.
If you set Include track to On, the track of the device is displayed in degrees.
Device name	The name of the device, as configured from the Edit device properties pane.
Battery level	The level of battery of the device when it recorded the media.
Optional: To delete a metadata element, click  Delete element.
The deleted element returns to the drop-down list, and can be reselected for use again.
To save the changes, click Save settings.
These changes affect all devices whose device profile has Show video metadata overlay set to On. The changes do not apply retroactively to media files that have already been recorded. For more information, see Performing Device Profiles Actions.

In the Pattern field, enter the pattern of the validator.
This action should be done utilising regular expressions.
Optional: If you want the validator to ignore the case of the text entered into the incident field, set Case insensitive to On.
If set to Off, the case of the text entered into the incident field must match that of the Pattern field.
Optional: If you want to test the validator, in the Test text field, enter the example text.
VideoManager determines whether the example text would be accepted by the validator or not.
Click Confirm.
Postrequisites:
After validators have been created, they must be individually applied to incident fields to ensure that the incident fields obey the patterns detailed in the validators. This action must be done during incident field creation. Validators cannot be edited after a incident field has been created.

For more information, see Creating Incident Fields.

Reordering Incident Fields

When users create an incident, the incident fields to be populated are presented in the same order that has been configured here.
For more information, see Creating Incidents Manually and Performing Incident Actions.

Creating Incident Fields
VideoManager comes with some built-in incident fields, which enable users to categorise incidents. Administrators can also create their own incident fields and edit built-in fields to reflect the unique needs of their organisation.
Prerequisites:

Before you create new incident fields, you can create validators, which define how information entered into incident fields must be formatted, for example, as a UK postcode.
For more information, see Creating and Applying Validators.

If the new incident field should show users a different display name based on their session language, you should change the language for your own session before you create the field so that it does not match the server language of VideoManager. This action can be done from either the account menu or the  Language section.
For more information, see Configuring the Language on VideoManager.

Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Incidents pane.
Click the  Incident Fields section and perform one of the following actions:
If you are creating an incident field which users must populate while creating an incident, click  Create field.
If you are creating a incident field which users must populate before deleting an incident, scroll to the Incident Deletion Fields section and click  Create field.
In the Identifier field, enter an identifier for the incident field.
The identifier should be all lowercase, and unique.
In the Display name field, enter a display name for the incident field.
The display name is what the incident field is called in the VideoManager UI.
Note: An optional second display name field appears if your session language does not currently match the server language of VideoManager. The field enables you to enter a display name for the field in both languages. If the display name should be set in more than two languages, you must complete the field, save it, then change your session to the third language and edit the field.
From the Type drop-down list, select the type of a incident field to be created:
Name	Description
Text	In this incident field, users can enter text related to the incident, which is useful if users need to search for a specific phrase or word, such as Assault, Arrest, and more.
Text List	In this incident field, users can select one or more texts related to the incident.
Date	In this incident field, users can select a date related to the incident.
Date & Time	In this incident field, users can select a date and time related to the incident.
Drop down	In this incident field, users can select an option from a drop-down list related to the incident.
Check box	In this incident field, users can either select or unselect a check box related to the incident.
URL	In this incident field, users can enter a URL related to the incident.
Computed	In this incident field, users can create URLs from previously created incident fields. Administrators can also configure computed fields to appear, and change their appearance, based on how other incident fields are populated.
Tag List	In this incident field, users can select one or more tags related to the incident.
Auto-delete	In this incident field, users can enter the conditions for auto-delete and the date when the incident should be automatically deleted.
Note: The type of incident field cannot be changed later.
Optional: If you do not want users to be able to save an incident unless they populate the field, set Mandatory to On.
From the Permission group drop-down list, select to which access group the incident field should apply.
Any users in the selected access group are able to view and edit the incident field when creating and editing incidents.
If all users should be able to utilise the incident field when creating and editing incidents, you can select Public.

Computed fields do not need to have the same permission groups as the other incident fields that determine whether they appear or not. For example, if only some administrators should be able to populate the review-status field with sensitive information, but all users should be able to see the more general reviewed-already computed field, review-status could be set to Access Group One, while reviewed-already could be set to Public.

From the Column width drop-down list, select how wide the column of the incident field should appear in incident search results.
This action is only relevant if the incident field is configured to appear in the incident search results pane.
For more information, see Configuring User-Defined Field Layouts.

Depending on the type of incident field to be created, perform one of the following actions:

You can create incident fields to meet unique needs of your organisation. However, VideoManager comes with two types of built-in incident field, which can be edited as well. The steps for editing default fields differ, depending on the type of field.

Default incident fields, which are manually populated by users when creating incidents, can have every aspect of their configuration edited, which is similar to non-default incident fields. These aspects are the following fields: Title, Incident time, Reference code, and Notes.

Default incident fields which are automatically populated by VideoManager when the incident is saved can only have specific aspects of their configuration edited. These aspects are the following fields: Creation time, Update time, Clip count, Owner, and Signature, and have an  icon next to their display names.

Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Incidents pane.
Click the  Incident Fields section.
Next to the relevant default field, click  Edit field.
Perform one of the following actions:
You can edit any of the following criteria. They are not mandatory.
Option	Actions
Editing an incident field that is manually populated	
In the Identifier field, enter an updated identifier for the incident field.
The identifier should be all lowercase, and unique.

In the Display name field, enter an updated display name for the incident field.
If you want users to be unable to save an incident unless they populate this field, set Mandatory to On.
From the Permission group drop-down list, select to which access group this incident field should apply.
Any users in the selected access group will be able to view this incident field when creating and editing incidents.

From the Column width drop-down list, select how wide the column for the incident field should appear in incident search results.
This action is only relevant if the incident field is configured to appear in the incident search results pane. For more information, see Configuring User-Defined Field Layouts.

Depending on the type of incident field that is being edited, edit other settings:
If you are editing the title, reference-code, or notes field, you can change the configuration in the Text section.
For more information, see Creating Text Fields.

If you are editing the incident-time field, you can change the configuration in the Date & Time section.
For more information, see Creating Date and Time Fields.

Editing a incident field which is automatically populated by VideoManager	
In the Display name field, enter an updated display name for the incident field.
From the Permission group drop-down list, select to which access group this incident field should apply.
Any users in the selected access group will be able to view this incident field when creating and editing incidents.

From the Column width drop-down list, select how wide the column for the incident field should appear in incident search results.
This action is only relevant if the incident field is configured to appear in the incident search results pane. For more information, see Configuring User-Defined Field Layouts.

If you do not want the incident field to be visible when users edit and view incidents, set Show in summary to No.
Click Save settings.
Editing Incident Clip Field Visibility
When a media file is added to an incident, it becomes an incident clip. Incident clips have four properties: Operator, Origin, Duration, and Notes. By default, all users on VideoManager can see these four fields. However, administrators can restrict which fields can be seen by users, based on the users' permission groups.
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Incidents pane.
Click the  Incident Fields section.
Scroll to the Incident Clip Fields section, and next to the field to be edited, click  View field.
There are four fields – one for each incident clip property.
From the Permission group drop-down list, select which users should be able to view the incident clip property.
By default, the drop-down list is set to Public, meaning that all users on VideoManager and anyone with an incident link can view this property. The administrator can select a specific permission group from the drop-down list, so users can only view this property if one of their roles has this permission group enabled.
For more information, see Field Permissions.

Note: The administrator cannot edit the incident clip field further. Incident clip fields cannot be deleted, either.
Click Save settings.
Postrequisites:
You can configure which of these fields are visible when viewing an incident link. For more information, see Configuring Incident Sharing.

Incident Fields and Rules Configuration for the M500/M500E
After you have conﬁgured media ﬁelds for the M500/M500E, you can dictate whether these ﬁelds are synchronized to corresponding incident ﬁelds, meaning they will be visible in an incident form containing the video, and whether VideoManager will automatically create incidents from videos tagged as critical.
Creating an M500/M500E Event Category Incident Field
The M500/M500E event category media ﬁeld enables operators to categorise recordings on the M500/M500E itself. However, by default, the value selected in this ﬁeld only appears alongside the individual recording, and it does not appear in incidents the recording is added to. To synchronize this media ﬁeld, so that its value appears in associated incidents, you must create a new incident ﬁeld.

Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Incidents pane.
Click the  Incident Fields section.
In the top right-hand corner, click  Create field.
In the Identifier field, enter EventCategory
Note: The identiﬁer must be set to EventCategory, or the two ﬁelds will not synchronize.
In the Display name field, enter a display name for the incident field.
The display name is what the incident field is called in the VideoManager UI.
Note: An optional second display name field appears if your session language does not currently match the server language of VideoManager. The field enables you to enter a display name for the field in both languages. If the display name should be set in more than two languages, you must complete the field, save it, then change your session to the third language and edit the field.
From the Type drop-down list, select Drop down.
If you want users to complete this field before they can proceed, set Mandatory to Yes.
From the Permission group drop-down list, select which access group should be able to see this field when viewing the video on VideoManager.
From the Column width drop-down list, select how much space this field should take up when displayed on VideoManager.
Scroll down to the Drop down section and recreate all of the values of the EventCategory media field by clicking  in the top right-hand corner, and adding each value one by one.
Note: The incident ﬁeld must have the exact same values as the media ﬁeld, or the two ﬁelds will not synchronize.
For more information, see 10 in the Editing the M500/M500E Event Category Media Field.

Optional: To conﬁgure whether the ﬁeld only appears in the Edit properties pane of a video when another drop down ﬁeld or check box ﬁeld has been populated in a speciﬁc manner, scroll down to the Conditions section and perform the following actions:
Ensure that there is at least one drop down ﬁeld or check box ﬁeld on VideoManager already.
Conditions can only be used on these ﬁelds.
In the top right-hand corner, click  New condition.
From the Field drop-down list, select which drop down ﬁeld or check box ﬁeld should dictate the appearance of this ﬁeld.
From the Value drop-down list, select which values of the drop down ﬁeld or check box ﬁeld should dictate the appearance of this ﬁeld.
This action is presented as a check box if a check box ﬁeld has been chosen, and a drop-down list if a drop down ﬁeld has been chosen.
Click Conﬁrm.
Click Save settings.
Enabling and Configuring Automatic Incident Creation
You can conﬁgure VideoManager to automatically create an incident for each video which has been tagged as critical on the M500, as soon as those videos have been imported.

Procedure:

Exporting and Importing Incident Share Reason Fields
If you have multiple instances of VideoManager, you can transfer a copy of your incident share reason fields from one instance to another.
Procedure:
In the original instance of VideoManager, navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Incidents pane.
Click the  Incident Share Reason Fields section.
Click  Export.
The incident share reason fields are saved to the default download location of your PC.
In the new instance of VideoManager (or a site, if User-defined Fields has been set to Off in the  Metadata/Footage Replication section), navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Incidents pane.
Click the  Incident Share Reason Fields section.
Click  Import.
Select the previously downloaded incident share reason fields.
Click Import.
Alternatively, if you want to import all of your incident share reason fields simultaneously, you can do so from the  Import/Export System Config section of the  System pane, in the Admin tab.
For more information, see Exporting and Importing the Configuration of VideoManager.

Creating and Applying Validators
You can control the format of information entered into incident share reason fields. This action can be done through the creation of validators, which can be configured to accept certain patterns and reject others, for example, a UK postcode or a URL.
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Incidents pane.
Click the  Incident Share Reason Fields section.
Click  Edit validators.
Click  Create validator.
In the Identifier field, enter a unique name for the validator.
In the Description field, enter the text which users should see when populating an incident share reason field.
The description should detail the format to which the incident share reason field should adhere.
In the Pattern field, enter the pattern of the validator.
This action should be done utilising regular expressions.
Optional: If you want the validator to ignore the case of the text entered into the incident share reason field, set Case insensitive to On.
If set to Off, the case of the text entered into the incident share reason field must match that of the Pattern field.
Optional: If you want to test the validator, in the Test text field, enter the example text.
VideoManager determines whether the example text would be accepted by the validator or not.
Click Confirm.
Postrequisites:
After validators have been created, they must be individually applied to incident share reason fields to ensure that the incident share reason fields obey the patterns detailed in the validators. This action must be done during incident share reason field creation. Validators cannot be edited after a incident share reason field has been created.

For more information, see Creating Incident Share Reason Fields.

Reordering Incident Share Reason Fields
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Incidents pane.
Click the  Incident Share Reason Fields section.
Click   Reorder fields.
Grab the left-hand side of the relevant media field and drag it to the desired location in the list.
Click Confirm.
When users edit a media file, the incident share reason fields to be populated are presented in the same order which has been configured here.
Creating Incident Share Reason Fields
Incident share reason fields are used in conjunction with the playback policy. When a user wants to share a media file, which is a certain number of days old, VideoManager prompts them to give a reason as to why they want to share it. The user must then enter their answer in the previously created incident share reason field.
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Incidents pane.
Click the  Incident Share Reason Fields section.
The process for creating incident share reason fields is the same as the process for creating incident fields, but with fewer options. Administrators can create as many incident share reason fields as necessary.

For more information, see Creating Incident Fields.

Postrequisites:
After you have created incident share reason fields, you can perform actions on these incident share reason fields from the Incident Share Reason Fields pane. You can:

Export incident share reason fields from one instance of VideoManager, and import them into another instance.
For more information, see Exporting and Importing Incident Share Reason Fields.

Reorder incident share reason fields, which affects how incident share reason fields are presented.
For more information, see Reordering Incident Share Reason Fields.

Configuring Incident Exports
You can configure export profiles, which determine how an incident is exported from VideoManager to the user's PC. Export profiles control how exports are handled on VideoManager. For example, how they are formatted, and more.

From the appropriate pane, you can perform the following actions:

Create an export profile.
Change whether incidents are automatically exported on creation or not.
Change DVD export defaults.
Enable accelerated export jobs. If the PC running VideoManager has nVidia hardware, this action increases the rate at which export jobs are processed.
The types of export profile that you can create are as follows:

DVD
For more information, see Creating DVD Export Profiles.

MP4
For more information, see Creating MP4 Export Profiles.

Evidence Export
For more information, see Creating Evidence Export Profiles.

Enabling Automatic Incident Exports
You can change whether incidents are automatically exported upon creation, which is useful if, due to an organisation's workflow, every incident must be reviewed externally as soon as they have been saved. You can create an export profile first, which all automatically exported incidents will use.
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Incidents pane.
Click the  Incident Exports section.
Set Export incident on create to On.
From the Auto-export profile drop-down list, select the previously created export profile that automatically exported incidents should inhabit.
Note: You can set rules for export profiles to dictate whether the export profile can be applied to the relevant incident, based on the status of the incident fields of the incident. However, automatic export ignores any rules set by the selected export profile.
Click Save settings.
Changing the DVD Export Defaults
This action can be necessary if an organisation consistently uses a specific type of media.
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Incidents pane.
Click the  Incident Exports section.
In the DVD export defaults section, from the drop-down list, choose a desired option.

If Include original footage is set to Yes, the export includes the original, full-length media from which the incident clips were taken.
If Include clip footage is set to Yes, the export includes the clips of the incident.
If Include confidential metadata is set to Yes, the export includes the fields of the incident as a JSON file. This action is useful if the user is planning to upload the incident to another instance of VideoManager. This action allows VideoManager to automatically populate the incident fields when the incident is uploaded.
If Single file per incident clip is set to Yes, the export includes every redacted incident clip as individual media files instead of one long media file.
Click Save settings.
Configuring Incident Sharing
Users can share incidents externally using a link. Administrators can configure which email address these links are sent to, if most or all links will be sent to the same address. Administrators can also set the default expiry time for a link, after which the incident becomes inaccessible to anyone who does not have an account on VideoManager, and configure which incident clip fields are visible in a link.
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Incidents pane.
Click the  Incident Sharing section.
In the Default email address field, enter the email address, which should be the default recipient for incident links.
Users can override this email address when creating a link from the Incidents tab.
In the Default expiry time field, enter the default number of days for which a link should be active, before it expires.
Users can override this expiry time when creating a link from the Incidents tab. For more information, see Sharing Incidents Externally Using a Link.
Optional: In the Incident link visible fields section, configure which incident clip fields are visible when an incident is shared via an incident link.
This action depends on which incident clip fields are visible to specific permission groups, as configured in the  Incident Fields section. For example, if the Operator field is configured so that only users in permission group one can view it, then you could enable Access Group One here. This means that the Operator property would be visible in the incident link.
For more information, see Editing Incident Clip Field Visibility.

Click Save settings.
Configuring Incident Settings
If VideoManager was upgraded to 17.0 or higher, media files, which have been added to an incident, that is incident clips, are presented by default as separate clips within that incident, regardless of which recording they came from. However, you can configure VideoManager to present incident clips as children of the original recording they came from. This action enables other users on the system to directly compare the original recording to the redacted and shortened incident clips.
If VideoManager was installed with 17.0 or higher, incident clips are presented by default as children of the original recording they came from. However, you can configure VideoManager to present incident clips as separate clips within that incident, regardless of which recording they came from.
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  Incidents pane.
Click the  Incident Settings section.
Set Group incident clips by recording to either Yes or No.
From the Incident label field drop-down list, select a single custom field to be used to identify this incident.

Note: Incidents always take precedence with deletion policies. Once removed from an incident, retention policy falls back to the media retention policy.
Some devices enable users to bookmark media in the field, drawing attention to certain portions of media. If Bookmark status is set to On, from the drop-down list, select how bookmarked media should be treated by the deletion policy of VideoManager. From the drop-down list, you can select for how long bookmarked media should be kept:
the same period as non-bookmarked media – If this option is selected, the deletion policy treats bookmarked and non-bookmarked media identically.
specified amount of time – If this option is selected, you have the option to configure for how long bookmarked media is kept. The default is 90 days.
If If it is part of a recording is set to On, an entire recording is kept if one media file within it has been added to an incident.
If set to Off, only media files that have been added to incidents are preserved. The larger recording is subject to the deletion policy of VideoManager like normal.

Overrides & recovery	
If Incident grace period is set to On, enter the number of days for which media is protected after it has been removed from an incident. Media in an incident is never deleted unless:
It has been manually removed from the incident.
The incident it is a part of has been deleted, in which case the media is subject to normal deletion policies.
Forced deletion is set to On.
If Recovery period is set to On, enter the number of days for which media is kept after deletion is requested, in case a media file has been deleted accidentally.
If Forced deletion is set to On, media is deleted even if it is part of an incident.
Normally, media is never deleted while it is part of an incident.

Click the Incidents section and select one of the following:
Name	Description
Never delete incidents	The default selection.
Delete after a certain amount of time	Allows you to specify the amount of time in days, months or years after the start date after which the incidents should be deleted.
From the start date drop-down list, you can choose between Creation date, Earliest incident clip start time, and Latest incident clip start time.

Delete based on their category	Categories are set up in the  Incident Fields section using either a tag list or drop down field. For more information, see Creating Incident Fields.

If Rolling audit log deletion is set to On, determine for how many days audit logs should be retained before they are automatically deleted by VideoManager.
If Annual audit log deletion is set to On, determine for how many years an audit log entry should be retained before it is automatically deleted by VideoManager.
The age of the audit log entry is calculated from midnight, January 1st. If a log entry is not the configured number of years old by that date, it is kept until the next year. For example, if the deletion policy is configured so that all entries are kept for one year, an audit log entry created on January 2nd 2020 will be deleted on January 1st 2022, because it was not one year old on January 1st 2021.

Note: If both Rolling audit log deletion and Annual audit log deletion are set to On, audit logs are deleted in line with whichever policy sets the earlier deletion date.
Click the Dashboard section and in the Show media scheduled to be deleted in <7> days field, enter the number of days within which a media file should be deleted, before it will show up on a user's dashboard.

File spaces determine where files from VideoManager are stored, how much space VideoManager can use, and whether the files are encrypted when they are stored. Files can be stored on the administrator's PC (if administrators have accepted the default file space configuration, file spaces are stored on the PC with the path C:\ProgramData\Motorola Solutions\VideoManager. ), network-attached storage, or Amazon S3 Object Storage/Azure Blob Storage (if it has been purchased). It is important to note that some files, such as temporary files and config files, are always kept on the local hard drive, even if VideoManager has been configured to use a different kind of storage.

Note: VideoManager only supports Amazon S3 Object Storage or Azure Blob Storage. Other kinds of object storage are not compatible and cannot be used to store files from VideoManager.
Devices generate large numbers of very large files. It is important to consider how much storage capacity will be required and how much bandwidth the storage system will require, which is why Motorola Solutions recommends dedicated network-attached storage. When file spaces are full, associated system functions will stop working. For example, devices will be unable to download media files, and will enter an error state.

You can administer your file spaces, which includes creating new file spaces, moving files within them, increasing their sizes, and deleting them.

Creating File Spaces
You can create new file spaces alongside existing ones. This action can be necessary if files should be stored in a different location, or if a file space of one type is becoming full and more space should be added.
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  System pane.
Click the  Storage section.
Click  Create file space.
The Create file space window opens.
Enter the path for the new file space.
If you have purchased S3 Object Storage or Azure Blob Storage, you should enter the name of a folder within the bucket, which will then be created.
Note: If you are using a grid configuration, you must ensure that the path can be accessed by all workers in the grid. For more information about setting up grids with VideoManager, see VideoManager and Grids Explained.
From the Category drop-down list, select a category for the file space.
The options are as follows:
Footage is where media on VideoManager are stored. Additionally, imported media files are stored here, too.
Exports is where exports on VideoManager are stored.
Reports is where reports on VideoManager are stored.
Backups is where system backups on VideoManager are stored.
Resources is where theme resources, such as logos, colour schemes, and device firmware, are stored on VideoManager.
Import Workspace is where temporary files are stored. This option is only necessary if a grid system with import workers is being used with VideoManager.
From the Container field, select the type of container for the file space.
The options are as follows:
Filesystem – The file space is contained in the filesystem.
If you have created a file container whose details correspond to either a S3 Object Storage or Azure Blob Storage container, you can select either of these storages.
In the Max size field, enter the maximum size that VideoManager should use in the file space.
Motorola Solutions recommends that the maximum size is not set to the absolute upper limit of the disk/drive, as VideoManager will behave incorrectly when the disk/drive is completely full.
Note: Because many object storage systems do not have a maximum capacity, this field ensures that storage costs are capped.
From the State drop-down list, select a state for the file space.
In most cases, the option is Online.
The other options are as follows:

OBSOLETE – Files in an obsolete file space are still available, but no new files will be written to the file space.
OFFLINE – Usually, if a file space is unexpectedly unavailable, VideoManager stops writing files to all file spaces. However, if a file space is marked as offline, VideoManager can continue using other file space. Files in the offline file space will be unplayable and inaccessible.
EVACUATE – This option automatically moves all data in the file space to the other file space(s) of the same type, which is useful if an old file space should not have any new files written to it, but the existing files within it should be kept.
Note: If another administrator on the system is viewing, editing, or exporting the data in a file space that is being evacuated, the evacuation is forced to wait until the other actions have finished.
If relevant, from the Encryption drop-down list, select an encryption type.
The options are as follows: None, AES-128, AES-192, or AES-256.
Note: If unsure, Motorola Solutions recommends choosing AES-256.
The encryption type cannot be changed later. If an encryption mode is chosen, you must download the encryption key after creation, and store it offsite. This action ensures that the data can be recovered later in case of a disaster.

To download the encryption key, you must click  Go to file space next to the file space whose encryption key should be downloaded, and click  Download Key.

The key is downloaded to the default download location of your PC. It should be transferred to a secure location offsite.

Optional: If you want all information relevant to the file space to be sent to the file space until it is full, set Preferred to Yes.
If multiple file spaces have Preferred set to Yes, VideoManager alternates between those file spaces when storing resources.

If no file spaces have Preferred set to Yes, VideoManager alternates between all file spaces when storing resources.

To save the changes, click Confirm.
Relocating Files
If you want to relocate the files in a file space to a new location, Motorola Solutions recommends creating an entirely new file space with the new desired path, and evacuating all files in the old file space over to it.
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  System pane.
Click the  Storage section.
If the new file space has not already been created, click  Create file space.
The Create file space window opens.
Enter the path for the new file space.
Configure the rest of the settings as desired, and ensure that Preferred is set to Yes.
Click Confirm.
Next to the old file space whose path must be changed, click  Go to file space.
From the Category drop-down list, select Evacuate.
The data in the old file space is evacuated to the file space with the new path. The evacuation can take some time.
Optional: After the old file space has been fully evacuated, delete it by clicking  Delete file space.
Changing the Path of File Spaces
Prerequisites:

Stop the VideoManager service from the services control panel on the PC running VideoManager.
Manually move the files to the new location, for example, by dragging and dropping the files into the new location on the PC.
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  System pane.
Click the  Storage section.
Next to the file space whose path you want to change, click  Go to file space.
Click Change.
Enter the new path.
Click Confirm.
Note: VideoManager will not save the changes if the data has not already been manually moved to the location specified in the new path.
Changing the Size of File Spaces
Changing the size of a file space can be necessary if more or less space has become available, or a space should be redistributed between file spaces.
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  System pane.
Click the  Storage section.
Next to the file space whose size you want to change, click  Go to file space.
In the Max size field, make the relevant changes.
Note: You cannot make the file space smaller than the size of the files which are already in the file space.
Click Confirm.
Deleting File Spaces
Deleting a file space involves evacuating all files in the file space to another suitable file space.
Procedure:
Ensure that there is at least one other file space on VideoManager whose Category matches that of the file space that is being deleted, and whose State is set to Online.
Next to the file space to be deleted, click  Go to file space.
From the Category drop-down list, select Evacuate.
Click Confirm.
The data in the deleted file space is evacuated to the other file space(s). This process may take hours or days, depending on the amount of information in the file space.
Optional: After the evacuation has finished, to check that all of the files have been evacuated correctly, click  Evacuation report.
Next to the now empty file space, click  Delete file space.
Note: File spaces should not be deleted until they have been evacuated. However, as a last resort, administrators can delete a file space whose status has been set to OFFLINE, if the files in the file space have been irretrievably lost.
Configuring File Space Warnings
You can configure file space warnings, which appear when file spaces reach a certain threshold. The warnings are useful because they ensure that administrators can take action before the file spaces are completely full.
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  System pane.
Click the  Storage section.
In the  File space warnings section, enable the relevant alarms and enter a percentage between 1 and 100% above which an alarm will be triggered.
The options are as follows:
Warn when media storage is above threshold
Warn when export storage is above threshold
Warn when backup storage is above threshold
Click Save settings.
From now on, whenever the Footage, Exports or Backups file spaces grow larger than the specified percentage, a system warning appears in the  Notifications pane on the administrator's homepage, and in the  System pane of the Status tab.
Configuring Report Settings
VideoManager automatically deletes reports if the report file space is becoming full. You can configure when your reports should be deleted and when scheduled reports should be run. You can also import a custom report schedule.
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  System pane.
Click the  Reports section.
In the Minimum auto-delete age field, enter the minimum number of days for which reports must have existed, before they are considered for deletion.
In the Scheduled report time field, select the time of day at which scheduled reports should run.
This setting affects all scheduled reports on VideoManager, and only dictates when reports are generated, not what times they cover.
In the Organization name field, add your organization's name.
From the Download reports as drop-down list, select the preferrable format of the downloaded report.
If you select ZIP or CSV, you can select either format from the drop-down list before downloading. If you select ZIP or CSV, the report is automatically downloaded in the selected format.
Click Save settings.
You can create a custom report schedule, which dictates what dates a scheduled report should cover, and is selectable by users when creating a scheduled report from the Status tab.
To create and import a custom schedule, perform the following actions:
Create a JSON file with the desired schedule.
You can create multiple schedules within one JSON file.

The format is as follows:

"name":"<NAME OF SCHEDULE>",
"scheduleDates": "startDay":<DAY OF MONTH>,"startMonth": <MONTH>,"endDay":<DAY OF MONTH>,"endMonth":<MONTH>
                              
The day and month should be entered numerically, so for example, April = 4, May = 5, etc.

In the following example, the JSON would import the schedule Test, which covers April 1st until May 20th.

"name":"Test",
"scheduleDates": "startDay":1,"startMonth": 4,"endDay":20,"endMonth":5
In the following example, the JSON would import the schedules Test and Test-2, which cover April 1st until May 20th and June 1st until July 20th, respectively.

"name":"Test",
"scheduleDates": "startDay":1,"startMonth": 4,"endDay":20,"endMonth":5 "name":"Test-2",
"scheduleDates": "startDay":1,"startMonth": 6,"endDay":20,"endMonth":7
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  System pane.
Click the  Reports section.
In the  Custom report schedule pane, click  Import custom schedule.
Select the relevant JSON file and click Import.
The imported schedule(s) immediately appear in the  Custom report schedule pane. Users can now select the schedule from the Schedule drop-down list when they create a report.
For more information, see Performing Report Actions.

Note: If you import a new JSON file to VideoManager, then all schedules with the same name are overwritten, and all schedules not mentioned in the new JSON file are deleted.
Click Save settings.
Configuring Listen and Public Addresses of VideoManager
A public address determines how users, devices, and docks access VideoManager on the network.

A listen address determines which connections VideoManager accepts from these users, devices, and docks.

It is possible to assign different purposes to different public and listen addresses. For example, one listen address for devices and one for users to access VideoManager via a browser.

It is important to configure a public address because otherwise users will only be able to access VideoManager on the PC where it is installed.

Configuring the Listen Address
By default, VideoManager will listen on port 9080 for all traffic. Before you add a new listen address, you should confirm that your organization’s firewall settings will allow access before changing ports. Otherwise, your users, devices or sites may lose access to VideoManager.

Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  System pane.
Click the  Web Server section.
In the Listen Addresses section, click  New listen address.
From the Purpose drop-down list, select Client certificate authenticated users.
Optional: If VideoManager should only listen on a certain address, in the Server address field, specify the server address.
In the Server port field, enter the server port.
Note: The server port must be different for each one for the list of listen addresses.
Set Use SSL? to On.
In the SSL certificate, click  Configure.
The same SSL certificate can be used for multiple listen address configurations.
Click Choose file.
The certificate format is usually .p12 or .pfx.
Select the certificate and click Open.
Enter the password.
Click OK.
Click Save settings.
The server restarts.
Configuring the Public Address
A public address is the address that web clients and devices use when not on the same network as the VideoManager instance. You must configure at least one public address.

Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  System pane.
Click the  Web Server section.
Scroll down to the Public Addresses section.
At the bottom of the section, in the lower right-hand corner, click  New public address.
From the Purpose drop-down list, select all purposes of the new address.
In the Public URL field, enter the fully qualified public URL used to access the service.
URL must include http:// or https:// at the beginning and the port number at the end, for example 9999
Click Save settings.
The server restarts.
Configuring Web Server Behaviour
The following options are available in the Web Server Behaviour section.

Procedure:
If you want to use web sockets for transmitting feed data instead of polling, set Use web socket feeds to On.
When enabled, currently logged on users must refresh their browsers to get the updated setting.
Note: This setting must be enabled for live viewing.
If you want sites to connect to this service to make their media available, set Central VideoManager Mode to On.
Uploaded media are available at the Centre once fetched.
Postrequisites:
Click Save settings.

Configuring SSL Certificates for Device Authentication
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  System pane.
Click the  Web Server section.
In the Listen Addresses section, click  New listen address.
From the Purpose drop-down list, select Client certificate authenticated devices.
Optional: In the Server address field, enter the server address.
In the Server port field, enter the server port.
Optional: Set Use certificate forwarding? to On.
Enabling this option allows you to download the certificate.
Ensure that Use SSL? is set to On.
In the SSL certificate field, click  Configure.
Click Choose file.
Note: Acceptable certificate formats are BASE64 and PEM.
Select the certificate and click Open.
Enter the password.
Click OK.
Click Save settings.
Migrating Access Control Key Authenticated Devices to New Addresses
As part of the implementation of the  Device Server Certificate Verification section, all access control key authenticated devices must have their own listen address. To enable certificate verification without having to manually reconfigure all docks, you can access the migration wizard to add new listen and public addresses for access control key authenticated devices, which will automatically send the new configuration to all connected docks.
Prerequisites:

Ensure that all of your docks are connected.
Note: Any docks that are not connected when you run the migration wizard will not be updated and will retain their previous settings. If certificate verification is enabled, devices may appear as unverified or locked depending on the selected mode until they are manually reconfigured or updated by running the migration wizard again.
Ensure that the port you choose is available in your network and reachable from all docks.
Allow for a maintenance window of up to one hour to complete the process.
Keep access control key authenticated devices on both the old and new listen addresses simultaneously, until all docks are reconfigured.
Ensure that the listen address set for access control key authenticated devices has an SSL certificate in place. The Multi-Domain (SAN) for the certificate must contain the host name or IP address of the VideoManager instance to be valid.
Procedure:
To access the migration wizard, perform the following actions:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  System pane.
Click the  Web Server section.
In the message at the top informing you that access control key authenticated devices must be on separate listen and public addresses, click Click to start setup.
The migration wizard opens in a new window.
In the Getting started page, click Next.
In the New server port field, enter the server port.
Enable the Use SSL toggle.
The Import SSL certificate button appears.
Click Import SSL certificate and select the certificate from your PC.
If the certificate is locked, the Passphrase field appears.
In the Passphrase field, enter the password for the certificate and click Unlock.
If the password is correct, more information about the certificate appears such as validity and subject.
If the password is incorrect, you receive an error message.

Ensure that the public URL is correct.
Note: If the public URL is incorrect, docks may not be able to establish a connection. Confirming saves your new addresses, restarts the server, and logs out all users.
Click Confirm.
The Test connection page informs you how many docks are connected, how many of those require reconfiguration, and how many are ready for reconfiguration.
If not all docks requiring reconfiguration pass the test, the docks retain the previous settings and you need to either manually reconfigure them or run the migration wizard again.

If no docks passed the test, an error message appears. You must review your configuration settings and ensure that they are valid.

Note: Reconfiguration can take some time. During the process, the docks will restart and all users will be logged out.
To start reconfiguration, click Start.
Note: During the process, you cannot close the window or refresh the page. If the process is interrupted, any remaining docks will not be reconfigured and you will have to relaunch the migration wizard to complete the process.
Once the process is complete, the message appears informing you how many docks were successfully reconfigured. If any docks failed to receive the new configuration, you can update them later by either running the migration wizard again once the docks are connected or by reconfiguring them manually. For more information, see Configuring Listen and Public Addresses of VideoManager.
Click Finish.
Postrequisites:
Once all docks are reconfigured to point to the new listen address/public address, remove access control key authenticated devices from the original server port.

Creating and Configuring Backup Databases
VideoManager offers a backup database service to help prevent the loss of crucial files in the event of an IT failure. A backup contains database metadata, such as the audit log, custom configurations, and descriptions of media files, incidents, and exports. These backups can be used by Motorola Solutions to restore an administrator's instance of VideoManager.

The backup function only backs up the system state and does not back up the contents of the media, exports or reports filespaces.

Note: Backups should be regularly transferred to a secure location offsite.
Creating Backup Databases
You can initiate an immediate backup, which captures the state of VideoManager at the time when the immediate backup was created.
Note: Only users with the Initiate immediate database backup permission can initiate the backup of the database.
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  System pane.
Click the  Backup Databases section.
Click Backup now.
The backup is sent to the location that has been configured in the  Storage section. For more information, see Performing File Spaces Actions.
Configuring Backup Databases
You can configure recurring backups, which run automatically every hour.
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  System pane.
Click the  Backup Databases section.
Set Enabled automatic database backups to On.
This action enables you to configure more settings relating to automatic backups.
Enter the number of most recent daily and hourly backups that should be retained.
A daily backup is the last hourly backup within a 24-hour window. It is recommended to configure both of these settings.
Optional: If you want backups to only occur when there is little or no activity occurring on VideoManager, in order to minimise system load, set Avoid busy times to On.
Click Save settings.
The backup is sent to the location that has been configured in the  Storage section. For more information, see Performing File Spaces Actions.
The current backup status, as well as the start and end date of the backup, are displayed at the bottom of the pane.

Importing and Deleting Licences
The Licences pane enables you to licence features of VideoManager, which would otherwise be inaccessible. It also allows you to view the licences you have already bought, the expiry dates of the licences, and the number of devices which your licences support.
Importing Licences
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  System pane.
Click the  Licences section.
Click  Import licence.
Click Choose file.
Note:
You should select the licence provided to you by Motorola Solutions. For more information, contact Motorola Solutions Support.

The maximum size of the licence can be 1 MB.

In the Activation key field, enter the key provided by Motorola Solutions in the licence email.
Note: If the key entered here does not match the key set by Motorola Solutions, the licence will not work.
Click Import.
If successful, the licence appears as Valid. All licences are on and enabled by default once imported.
Deleting Licences
An imported licence usually has an expiry date. A warning will appear on VideoManager when a licence is one week away from expiration. When the licence expires, VideoManager restarts. It can be necessary to delete a licence after it expired.
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  System pane.
Click the  Licences section.
Click  Delete licence.
If the licence is still valid, VideoManager presents a list of all the features which will stop working when the licence is deleted.

Advanced Settings Configuration
The advanced settings file allows you to configure specialised features, for a demonstration or tutorials. All edits to the file can be done from the  Advanced Settings section of the  System pane, in the Admin tab.

Note: The configuration should only be done if you have been given explicit permission from Motorola Solutions Support, and should not be attempted otherwise.
Setting the System Time Zone of VideoManager
For on-premises instances, by default, the  System Time Zone is the time zone of the operating system on which users are accessing VideoManager. For cloud instances, by default,  System Time Zone is the time zone of the server on which VideoManager is being hosted.

The system time zone of VideoManager affects a number of functions, including:

The start and end times for reports.
When scheduled reports run.
The interpretation of bandwidth rules, which apply to specific times or days.
The system time zone of VideoManager does not necessarily dictate video metadata, which is determined by the time zone of the device on which the video was recorded, which is itself determined by the following:

The time zone of the device profile.
For more information, see Device Profiles.

If the time zone of the device profile is left as the default, the time zone of a video is determined by the time zone of the dock to which the device is docked.
For more information, see Performing Dock Actions.

If the time zone of the dock is left as the default, the time zone of a video is determined by the system time zone of VideoManager.
Note: The system time zone can be changed to be independent of the host server time zone by users with the permission to edit System time zone.
Procedure:
Navigate to the Admin tab.
Select the  System pane.
Click the  System Time Zone section.
From the Time zone drop-down list, select the system time zone of VideoManager.
Click Save settings.

Creating a System Health Check
Normally, the IT department is able to monitor computers and ensure that they are working properly. However, in some deployment scenarios, it can be helpful to configure an automated check of the health of the computer and warn users that they should contact support if there is something wrong. In this case, the administrator can create a script to check the health of the local computer, for example, check that the disk RAID array is working correctly, and if not, provide a suitable error message to show to the user.
Procedure:
Navigate to the config folder of VideoManager.
By default, the folder is in the path C:\ProgramData\Motorola Solutions\VideoManager.
Note: If ProgramData is not visible, you should navigate to the View tab at the top of the pane, and select the Hidden Items check box.
In the config folder, create a file called health-check.bat.
The script should return an exit code of 1 to indicate that a warning should be shown to users and 2 to indicate that there is an error and that users should be prevented from using VideoManager. If the script outputs a line beginning Message:, then the message will be shown to users.
For example, the following batch file script would show the message This is an error to users and disable VideoManager:

echo Message:This is a warning
exit /b 1
Save the file, and from the  Server Controls section, restart VideoManager.
Perform one of the following actions:
Option	Actions
Configuring when the health check is run automatically
